- **Joel 1:1**
This is the word of the LORD that came to Joel son of Pethuel:
- **Joel 1:2**
Hear this, O elders; and give ear, all who dwell in the land. Has anything like this ever happened in your days or in the days of your fathers?
- **Joel 1:3**
Tell it to your children; let your children tell it to their children, and their children to the next generation.
- **Joel 1:4**
What the devouring locust has left, the swarming locust has eaten; what the swarming locust has left, the young locust has eaten; and what the young locust has left, the destroying locust has eaten.

Wake up, you drunkards, and weep; wail, all you drinkers of wine, because of the sweet wine, for it has been cut off from your mouth.
- **Joel 1:6**
For a nation has invaded My land, powerful and without number; its teeth are the teeth of a lion, and its fangs are the fangs of a lioness.
- **Joel 1:7**
It has laid waste My grapevine and splintered My fig tree. It has stripped off the bark and thrown it away; the branches have turned white.
- **Joel 1:8**
Wail like a virgin dressed in sackcloth, grieving for the husband of her youth.
- **Joel 1:9**
Grain and drink offerings have been cut off from the house of the LORD; the priests are in mourning, those who minister before the LORD.
- **Joel 1:10**
The field is ruined; the land mourns. For the grain is destroyed, the new wine is dried up, and the oil fails.
- **Joel 1:11**
Be dismayed, O farmers, wail, O vinedressers, over the wheat and barley, because the harvest of the field has perished.
- **Joel 1:12**
The grapevine is dried up, and the fig tree is withered; the pomegranate, palm, and apple—all the trees of the orchard—are withered. Surely the joy of mankind has dried up.
- **Joel 1:13**
Put on sackcloth and lament, O priests; wail, O ministers of the altar. Come, spend the night in sackcloth, O ministers of my God, because the grain and drink offerings are withheld from the house of your God.
- **Joel 1:14**
Consecrate a fast; proclaim a solemn assembly! Gather the elders and all the residents of the land to the house of the LORD your God, and cry out to the LORD.

Blow the ram’s horn in Zion; sound the alarm on My holy mountain! Let all who dwell in the land tremble, for the Day of the LORD is coming; indeed, it is near—
- **Joel 2:2**
a day of darkness and gloom, a day of clouds and blackness. Like the dawn overspreading the mountains a great and strong army appears, such as never was of old, nor will ever be in ages to come.
- **Joel 2:3**
Before them a fire devours, and behind them a flame scorches. The land before them is like the Garden of Eden, but behind them, it is like a desert wasteland—surely nothing will escape them.

- **Joel 2:7**
They charge like mighty men; they scale the walls like men of war. Each one marches in formation, not swerving from the course.
- **Joel 2:8**
They do not jostle one another; each proceeds in his path. They burst through the defenses, never breaking ranks.
- **Joel 2:9**

- **Joel 2:12**
“Yet even now,” declares the LORD, “return to Me with all your heart, with fasting, weeping, and mourning.”
- **Joel 2:13**
So rend your hearts and not your garments, and return to the LORD your God. For He is gracious and compassionate, slow to anger, abounding in loving devotion. And He relents from sending disaster.
- **Joel 2:14**
Who knows? He may turn and relent and leave a blessing behind Him—grain and drink offerings for the LORD your God.
- **Joel 2:15**
Blow the ram’s horn in Zion, consecrate a fast, proclaim a sacred assembly.
- **Joel 2:16**
Gather the people, sanctify the congregation, assemble the aged, gather the children, even those nursing at the breast. Let the bridegroom leave his room, and the bride her chamber.
- **Joel 2:17**
Let the priests who minister before the LORD weep between the portico and the altar, saying, “Spare Your people, O LORD, and do not make Your heritage a reproach, an object of scorn among the nations. Why should they say among the peoples, ‘Where is their God?’”
