title:: Holy Bible/Isaiah

- **Isaiah 1:1**
This is the vision concerning Judah and Jerusalem that Isaiah son of Amoz saw during the reigns of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah.
- **Isaiah 1:2**
Listen, O heavens, and give ear, O earth, for the LORD has spoken: “I have raised children and brought them up, but they have rebelled against Me.
- **Isaiah 1:3**
The ox knows its owner, and the donkey its master’s manger, but Israel does not know; My people do not understand.”
- **Isaiah 1:4**
Alas, O sinful nation, a people laden with iniquity, a brood of evildoers, children of depravity! They have forsaken the LORD; they have despised the Holy One of Israel and turned their backs on Him.
- **Isaiah 1:5**
Why do you want more beatings? Why do you keep rebelling? Your head has a massive wound, and your whole heart is afflicted.
- **Isaiah 1:6**
From the sole of your foot to the top of your head, there is no soundness—only wounds and welts and festering sores neither cleansed nor bandaged nor soothed with oil.
- **Isaiah 1:7**
Your land is desolate; your cities are burned with fire. Foreigners devour your fields before you—a desolation demolished by strangers.
- **Isaiah 1:8**
And the Daughter of Zion is abandoned like a shelter in a vineyard, like a shack in a cucumber field, like a city besieged.
- **Isaiah 1:9**
Unless the LORD of Hosts had left us a few survivors, we would have become like Sodom, we would have resembled Gomorrah.
- **Isaiah 1:10**
Hear the word of the LORD, you rulers of Sodom; listen to the instruction of our God, you people of Gomorrah!
- **Isaiah 1:11**
“What good to Me is your multitude of sacrifices?” says the LORD. “I am full from the burnt offerings of rams and the fat of well-fed cattle; I take no delight in the blood of bulls and lambs and goats.
- **Isaiah 1:12**
When you come to appear before Me, who has required this of you—this trampling of My courts?
- **Isaiah 1:13**
Bring your worthless offerings no more; your incense is detestable to Me—your New Moons, Sabbaths, and convocations. I cannot endure iniquity in a solemn assembly.
- **Isaiah 1:14**
I hate your New Moons and your appointed feasts. They have become a burden to Me; I am weary of bearing them.
- **Isaiah 1:15**
When you spread out your hands in prayer, I will hide My eyes from you; even though you multiply your prayers, I will not listen. Your hands are covered with blood.
- **Isaiah 1:16**
Wash and cleanse yourselves. Remove your evil deeds from My sight. Stop doing evil!
- **Isaiah 1:17**
Learn to do right; seek justice and correct the oppressor. Defend the fatherless and plead the case of the widow.”
- **Isaiah 1:18**
“Come now, let us reason together,” says the LORD. “Though your sins are like scarlet, they will be as white as snow; though they are as red as crimson, they will become like wool.
- **Isaiah 1:19**
If you are willing and obedient, you will eat the best of the land.
- **Isaiah 1:20**
But if you resist and rebel, you will be devoured by the sword.” For the mouth of the LORD has spoken.
- **Isaiah 1:21**
See how the faithful city has become a harlot! She once was full of justice; righteousness resided within her, but now only murderers!
- **Isaiah 1:22**
Your silver has become dross; your fine wine is diluted with water.
- **Isaiah 1:23**
Your rulers are rebels, friends of thieves. They all love bribes and chasing after rewards. They do not defend the fatherless, and the plea of the widow never comes before them.
- **Isaiah 1:24**
Therefore the Lord GOD of Hosts, the Mighty One of Israel, declares: “Ah, I will be relieved of My foes and avenge Myself on My enemies.
- **Isaiah 1:25**
I will turn My hand against you; I will thoroughly purge your dross; I will remove all your impurities.
- **Isaiah 1:26**
I will restore your judges as at first, and your counselors as at the beginning. After that you will be called the City of Righteousness, the Faithful City.”
- **Isaiah 1:27**
Zion will be redeemed with justice, her repentant ones with righteousness.
- **Isaiah 1:28**
But rebels and sinners will together be shattered, and those who forsake the LORD will perish.
- **Isaiah 1:29**
Surely you will be ashamed of the sacred oaks in which you have delighted; you will be embarrassed by the gardens that you have chosen.
- **Isaiah 1:30**
For you will become like an oak whose leaves are withered, like a garden without water.
- **Isaiah 1:31**
The strong man will become tinder and his work will be a spark; both will burn together, with no one to quench the flames.
- **Isaiah 2:1**
This is the message that was revealed to Isaiah son of Amoz concerning Judah and Jerusalem:
- **Isaiah 2:2**
In the last days the mountain of the house of the LORD will be established as the chief of the mountains; it will be raised above the hills, and all nations will stream to it.
- **Isaiah 2:3**
And many peoples will come and say: “Come, let us go up to the mountain of the LORD, to the house of the God of Jacob. He will teach us His ways so that we may walk in His paths.” For the law will go forth from Zion, and the word of the LORD from Jerusalem.
- **Isaiah 2:4**
Then He will judge between the nations and arbitrate for many peoples. They will beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning hooks. Nation will no longer take up the sword against nation, nor train anymore for war.
- **Isaiah 2:5**
Come, O house of Jacob, let us walk in the light of the LORD.
- **Isaiah 2:6**
For You have abandoned Your people, the house of Jacob, because they are filled with influences from the east; they are soothsayers like the Philistines; they strike hands with the children of foreigners.
- **Isaiah 2:7**
Their land is full of silver and gold, with no limit to their treasures; their land is full of horses, with no limit to their chariots.
- **Isaiah 2:8**
Their land is full of idols; they bow down to the work of their hands, to what their fingers have made.
- **Isaiah 2:9**
So mankind is brought low, and man is humbled—do not forgive them!
- **Isaiah 2:10**
Go into the rocks and hide in the dust from the terror of the LORD and the splendor of His majesty.
- **Isaiah 2:11**
The proud look of man will be humbled, and the loftiness of men brought low; the LORD alone will be exalted in that day.
- **Isaiah 2:12**
For the Day of the LORD of Hosts will come against all the proud and lofty, against all that is exalted—it will be humbled—
- **Isaiah 2:13**
against all the cedars of Lebanon, lofty and lifted up, against all the oaks of Bashan,
- **Isaiah 2:14**
against all the tall mountains, against all the high hills,
- **Isaiah 2:15**
against every high tower, against every fortified wall,
- **Isaiah 2:16**
against every ship of Tarshish, and against every stately vessel.
- **Isaiah 2:17**
So the pride of man will be brought low, and the loftiness of men will be humbled; the LORD alone will be exalted in that day,
- **Isaiah 2:18**
and the idols will vanish completely.
- **Isaiah 2:19**
Men will flee to caves in the rocks and holes in the ground, away from the terror of the LORD and from the splendor of His majesty, when He rises to shake the earth.
- **Isaiah 2:20**
In that day men will cast away to the moles and bats their idols of silver and gold—the idols they made to worship.
- **Isaiah 2:21**
They will flee to caverns in the rocks and crevices in the cliffs, away from the terror of the LORD and from the splendor of His majesty, when He rises to shake the earth.
- **Isaiah 2:22**
Put no more trust in man, who has only the breath in his nostrils. Of what account is he?
- **Isaiah 3:1**
For behold, the Lord GOD of Hosts is about to remove from Jerusalem and Judah both supply and support: the whole supply of food and water,
- **Isaiah 3:2**
the mighty man and the warrior, the judge and the prophet, the soothsayer and the elder,
- **Isaiah 3:3**
the commander of fifty and the dignitary, the counselor, the cunning magician, and the clever enchanter.
- **Isaiah 3:4**
“I will make mere lads their leaders, and children will rule over them.”
- **Isaiah 3:5**
The people will oppress one another, man against man, neighbor against neighbor; the young will rise up against the old, and the base against the honorable.
- **Isaiah 3:6**
A man will seize his brother within his father’s house: “You have a cloak—you be our leader! Take charge of this heap of rubble.”
- **Isaiah 3:7**
On that day he will cry aloud: “I am not a healer. I have no food or clothing in my house. Do not make me leader of the people!”
- **Isaiah 3:8**
For Jerusalem has stumbled and Judah has fallen because they spoke and acted against the LORD, defying His glorious presence.
- **Isaiah 3:9**
The expression on their faces testifies against them, and like Sodom they flaunt their sin; they do not conceal it. Woe to them, for they have brought disaster upon themselves.
- **Isaiah 3:10**
Tell the righteous it will be well with them, for they will enjoy the fruit of their labor.
- **Isaiah 3:11**
Woe to the wicked; disaster is upon them! For they will be repaid with what their hands have done.
- **Isaiah 3:12**
Youths oppress My people, and women rule over them. O My people, your guides mislead you; they turn you from your paths.
- **Isaiah 3:13**
The LORD arises to contend; He stands to judge the people.
- **Isaiah 3:14**
The LORD brings this charge against the elders and leaders of His people: “You have devoured the vineyard; the plunder of the poor is in your houses.
- **Isaiah 3:15**
Why do you crush My people and grind the faces of the poor?” declares the Lord GOD of Hosts.
- **Isaiah 3:16**
The LORD also says: “Because the daughters of Zion are haughty—walking with heads held high and wanton eyes, prancing and skipping as they go, jingling the bracelets on their ankles—
- **Isaiah 3:17**
the Lord will bring sores on the heads of the daughters of Zion, and the LORD will make their foreheads bare.”
- **Isaiah 3:18**
In that day the Lord will take away their finery: their anklets and headbands and crescents;
- **Isaiah 3:19**
their pendants, bracelets, and veils;
- **Isaiah 3:20**
their headdresses, ankle chains, and sashes; their perfume bottles and charms;
- **Isaiah 3:21**
their signet rings and nose rings;
- **Isaiah 3:22**
their festive robes, capes, cloaks, and purses;
- **Isaiah 3:23**
and their mirrors, linen garments, tiaras, and shawls.
- **Isaiah 3:24**
Instead of fragrance there will be a stench; instead of a belt, a rope; instead of styled hair, baldness; instead of fine clothing, sackcloth; instead of beauty, shame.
- **Isaiah 3:25**
Your men will fall by the sword, and your warriors in battle.
- **Isaiah 3:26**
And the gates of Zion will lament and mourn; destitute, she will sit on the ground.
- **Isaiah 4:1**
In that day seven women will take hold of one man and say, “We will eat our own bread and provide our own clothes. Just let us be called by your name. Take away our disgrace!”
- **Isaiah 4:2**
On that day the Branch of the LORD will be beautiful and glorious, and the fruit of the land will be the pride and glory of Israel’s survivors.
- **Isaiah 4:3**
Whoever remains in Zion and whoever is left in Jerusalem will be called holy—all in Jerusalem who are recorded among the living—
- **Isaiah 4:4**
when the Lord has washed away the filth of the daughters of Zion and cleansed the bloodstains from the heart of Jerusalem by a spirit of judgment and a spirit of fire.
- **Isaiah 4:5**
Then the LORD will create over all of Mount Zion and over her assemblies a cloud of smoke by day and a glowing flame of fire by night. For over all the glory there will be a canopy,
- **Isaiah 4:6**
a shelter to give shade from the heat by day, and a refuge and hiding place from the storm and the rain.
- **Isaiah 5:1**
I will sing for my beloved a song of his vineyard: My beloved had a vineyard on a very fertile hill.
- **Isaiah 5:2**
He dug it up and cleared the stones and planted the finest vines. He built a watchtower in the middle and dug out a winepress as well. He waited for the vineyard to yield good grapes, but the fruit it produced was sour!
- **Isaiah 5:3**
“And now, O dwellers of Jerusalem and men of Judah, I exhort you to judge between Me and My vineyard.
- **Isaiah 5:4**
What more could I have done for My vineyard than I already did for it? Why, when I expected sweet grapes, did it bring forth sour fruit?
- **Isaiah 5:5**
Now I will tell you what I am about to do to My vineyard: I will take away its hedge, and it will be consumed; I will tear down its wall, and it will be trampled.
- **Isaiah 5:6**
I will make it a wasteland, neither pruned nor cultivated, and thorns and briers will grow up. I will command the clouds that rain shall not fall on it.”
- **Isaiah 5:7**
For the vineyard of the LORD of Hosts is the house of Israel, and the men of Judah are the plant of His delight. He looked for justice, but saw bloodshed; for righteousness, but heard a cry of distress.
- **Isaiah 5:8**
Woe to you who add house to house and join field to field until no place is left and you live alone in the land.
- **Isaiah 5:9**
I heard the LORD of Hosts declare: “Surely many houses will become desolate, great mansions left unoccupied.
- **Isaiah 5:10**
For ten acres of vineyard will yield but a bath of wine, and a homer of seed only an ephah of grain.”
- **Isaiah 5:11**
Woe to those who rise early in the morning in pursuit of strong drink, who linger into the evening, to be inflamed by wine.
- **Isaiah 5:12**
At their feasts are the lyre and harp, tambourines and flutes and wine. They disregard the actions of the LORD and fail to see the work of His hands.
- **Isaiah 5:13**
Therefore My people will go into exile for their lack of understanding; their dignitaries are starving and their masses are parched with thirst.
- **Isaiah 5:14**
Therefore Sheol enlarges its throat and opens wide its enormous jaws, and down go Zion’s nobles and masses, her revelers and carousers!
- **Isaiah 5:15**
So mankind will be brought low, and each man humbled; the arrogant will lower their eyes.
- **Isaiah 5:16**
But the LORD of Hosts will be exalted by His justice, and the holy God will show Himself holy in righteousness.
- **Isaiah 5:17**
Lambs will graze as in their own pastures, and strangers will feed in the ruins of the wealthy.
- **Isaiah 5:18**
Woe to those who draw iniquity with cords of deceit and pull sin along with cart ropes,
- **Isaiah 5:19**
to those who say, “Let Him hurry and hasten His work so that we may see it! Let the plan of the Holy One of Israel come so that we may know it!”
- **Isaiah 5:20**
Woe to those who call evil good and good evil, who turn darkness to light and light to darkness, who replace bitter with sweet and sweet with bitter.
- **Isaiah 5:21**
Woe to those who are wise in their own eyes and clever in their own sight.
- **Isaiah 5:22**
Woe to those who are heroes in drinking wine and champions in mixing strong drink,
- **Isaiah 5:23**
who acquit the guilty for a bribe and deprive the innocent of justice.
- **Isaiah 5:24**
Therefore, as a tongue of fire consumes the straw, and as dry grass shrivels in the flame, so their roots will decay and their blossoms will blow away like dust; for they have rejected the instruction of the LORD of Hosts and despised the word of the Holy One of Israel.
- **Isaiah 5:25**
Therefore the anger of the LORD burns against His people; His hand is raised against them to strike them down. The mountains quake, and the corpses lay like refuse in the streets. Despite all this, His anger is not turned away; His hand is still upraised.
- **Isaiah 5:26**
He lifts a banner for the distant nations and whistles for those at the ends of the earth. Behold—how speedily and swiftly they come!
- **Isaiah 5:27**
None of them grows weary or stumbles; no one slumbers or sleeps. No belt is loose and no sandal strap is broken.
- **Isaiah 5:28**
Their arrows are sharpened, and all their bows are strung. The hooves of their horses are like flint; their chariot wheels are like a whirlwind.
- **Isaiah 5:29**
Their roaring is like that of a lion; they roar like young lions. They growl and seize their prey; they carry it away from deliverance.
- **Isaiah 5:30**
In that day they will roar over it, like the roaring of the sea. If one looks over the land, he will see darkness and distress; even the light will be obscured by clouds.
- **Isaiah 6:1**
In the year that King Uzziah died, I saw the Lord seated on a throne, high and exalted; and the train of His robe filled the temple.
- **Isaiah 6:2**
Above Him stood seraphim, each having six wings: With two wings they covered their faces, with two they covered their feet, and with two they were flying.
- **Isaiah 6:3**
And they were calling out to one another: “Holy, holy, holy is the LORD of Hosts; all the earth is full of His glory.”
- **Isaiah 6:4**
At the sound of their voices the doorposts and thresholds shook, and the temple was filled with smoke.
- **Isaiah 6:5**
Then I said: “Woe is me, for I am ruined, because I am a man of unclean lips dwelling among a people of unclean lips; for my eyes have seen the King, the LORD of Hosts.”
- **Isaiah 6:6**
Then one of the seraphim flew to me, and in his hand was a glowing coal that he had taken with tongs from the altar.
- **Isaiah 6:7**
And with it he touched my mouth and said: “Now that this has touched your lips, your iniquity is removed and your sin is atoned for.”
- **Isaiah 6:8**
Then I heard the voice of the Lord saying: “Whom shall I send? Who will go for Us?” And I said: “Here am I. Send me!”
- **Isaiah 6:9**
And He replied: “Go and tell this people, ‘Be ever hearing, but never understanding; be ever seeing, but never perceiving.’
- **Isaiah 6:10**
Make the hearts of this people calloused; deafen their ears and close their eyes. Otherwise they might see with their eyes, hear with their ears, understand with their hearts, and turn and be healed.”
- **Isaiah 6:11**
Then I asked: “How long, O Lord?” And He replied: “Until the cities lie ruined and without inhabitant, until the houses are left unoccupied and the land is desolate and ravaged,
- **Isaiah 6:12**
until the LORD has driven men far away and the land is utterly forsaken.
- **Isaiah 6:13**
And though a tenth remains in the land, it will be burned again. As the terebinth and oak leave stumps when felled, so the holy seed will be a stump in the land.”
- **Isaiah 7:1**
Now in the days that Ahaz son of Jotham, the son of Uzziah, was king of Judah, Rezin king of Aram marched up to wage war against Jerusalem. He was accompanied by Pekah son of Remaliah the king of Israel, but he could not overpower the city.
- **Isaiah 7:2**
When it was reported to the house of David that Aram was in league with Ephraim, the hearts of Ahaz and his people trembled like trees in the forest shaken by the wind.
- **Isaiah 7:3**
Then the LORD said to Isaiah, “Go out with your son Shear-jashub to meet Ahaz at the end of the aqueduct that feeds the upper pool, on the road to the Launderer’s Field,
- **Isaiah 7:4**
and say to him: Calm down and be quiet. Do not be afraid or disheartened over these two smoldering stubs of firewood—over the fierce anger of Rezin and Aram and of the son of Remaliah.
- **Isaiah 7:5**
For Aram, along with Ephraim and the son of Remaliah, has plotted your ruin, saying:
- **Isaiah 7:6**
‘Let us invade Judah, terrorize it, and divide it among ourselves. Then we can install the son of Tabeal over it as king.’
- **Isaiah 7:7**
But this is what the Lord GOD says: ‘It will not arise; it will not happen.
- **Isaiah 7:8**
For the head of Aram is Damascus, and the head of Damascus is Rezin. Within sixty-five years Ephraim will be shattered as a people.
- **Isaiah 7:9**
The head of Ephraim is Samaria, and the head of Samaria is the son of Remaliah. If you do not stand firm in your faith, then you will not stand at all.’”
- **Isaiah 7:10**
Again the LORD spoke to Ahaz, saying,
- **Isaiah 7:11**
“Ask for a sign from the LORD your God, whether from the depths of Sheol or the heights of heaven.”
- **Isaiah 7:12**
But Ahaz replied, “I will not ask; I will not test the LORD.”
- **Isaiah 7:13**
Then Isaiah said, “Hear now, O house of David! Is it not enough to try the patience of men? Will you try the patience of my God as well?
- **Isaiah 7:14**
Therefore the Lord Himself will give you a sign: Behold, the virgin will be with child and will give birth to a son, and will call Him Immanuel.
- **Isaiah 7:15**
By the time He knows enough to reject evil and choose good, He will be eating curds and honey.
- **Isaiah 7:16**
For before the boy knows enough to reject evil and choose good, the land of the two kings you dread will be laid waste.
- **Isaiah 7:17**
The LORD will bring on you and on your people and on the house of your father a time unlike any since the day Ephraim separated from Judah—He will bring the king of Assyria.”
- **Isaiah 7:18**
On that day the LORD will whistle to the flies at the farthest streams of the Nile and to the bees in the land of Assyria.
- **Isaiah 7:19**
And they will all come and settle in the steep ravines and clefts of the rocks, in all the thornbushes and watering holes.
- **Isaiah 7:20**
On that day the Lord will use a razor hired from beyond the Euphrates—the king of Assyria—to shave your head and the hair of your legs, and to remove your beard as well.
- **Isaiah 7:21**
On that day a man will raise a young cow and two sheep,
- **Isaiah 7:22**
and from the abundance of milk they give, he will eat curds; for all who remain in the land will eat curds and honey.
- **Isaiah 7:23**
And on that day, in every place that had a thousand vines worth a thousand shekels of silver, only briers and thorns will be found.
- **Isaiah 7:24**
Men will go there with bow and arrow, for the land will be covered with briers and thorns.
- **Isaiah 7:25**
For fear of the briers and thorns, you will no longer traverse the hills once tilled by the hoe; they will become places for oxen to graze and sheep to trample.
- **Isaiah 8:1**
Then the LORD said to me, “Take a large scroll and write on it with an ordinary stylus: Maher-shalal-hash-baz.
- **Isaiah 8:2**
And I will appoint for Myself trustworthy witnesses—Uriah the priest and Zechariah son of Jeberekiah.”
- **Isaiah 8:3**
And I had relations with the prophetess, and she conceived and gave birth to a son. The LORD said to me, “Name him Maher-shalal-hash-baz.
- **Isaiah 8:4**
For before the boy knows how to cry ‘Father’ or ‘Mother,’ the wealth of Damascus and the plunder of Samaria will be carried off by the king of Assyria.”
- **Isaiah 8:5**
And the LORD spoke to me further:
- **Isaiah 8:6**
“Because this people has rejected the gently flowing waters of Shiloah and rejoiced in Rezin and the son of Remaliah,
- **Isaiah 8:7**
the Lord will surely bring against them the mighty floodwaters of the Euphrates—the king of Assyria and all his pomp. It will overflow its channels and overrun its banks.
- **Isaiah 8:8**
It will pour into Judah, swirling and sweeping over it, reaching up to the neck; its spreading streams will cover your entire land, O Immanuel!
- **Isaiah 8:9**
Huddle together, O peoples, and be shattered; pay attention, all you distant lands; prepare for battle, and be shattered; prepare for battle, and be shattered!
- **Isaiah 8:10**
Devise a plan, but it will be thwarted; state a proposal, but it will not happen. For God is with us.”
- **Isaiah 8:11**
For this is what the LORD has spoken to me with a strong hand, instructing me not to walk in the way of this people:
- **Isaiah 8:12**
“Do not call conspiracy everything these people regard as conspiracy. Do not fear what they fear; do not live in dread.
- **Isaiah 8:13**
The LORD of Hosts is the One you shall regard as holy. Only He should be feared; only He should be dreaded.
- **Isaiah 8:14**
And He will be a sanctuary—but to both houses of Israel a stone of stumbling and a rock of offense, to the dwellers of Jerusalem a trap and a snare.
- **Isaiah 8:15**
Many will stumble over these; they will fall and be broken; they will be ensnared and captured.”
- **Isaiah 8:16**
Bind up the testimony and seal the law among my disciples.
- **Isaiah 8:17**
I will wait for the LORD, who is hiding His face from the house of Jacob. I will put my trust in Him.
- **Isaiah 8:18**
Here am I, and the children the LORD has given me as signs and symbols in Israel from the LORD of Hosts, who dwells on Mount Zion.
- **Isaiah 8:19**
When men tell you to consult the spirits of the dead and the spiritists who whisper and mutter, shouldn’t a people consult their God instead? Why consult the dead on behalf of the living?
- **Isaiah 8:20**
To the law and to the testimony! If they do not speak according to this word, they have no light of dawn.
- **Isaiah 8:21**
They will roam the land, dejected and hungry. When they are famished, they will become enraged; and looking upward, they will curse their king and their God.
- **Isaiah 8:22**
Then they will look to the earth and see only distress and darkness and the gloom of anguish. And they will be driven into utter darkness.
- **Isaiah 9:1**
Nevertheless, there will be no more gloom for those in distress. In the past He humbled the land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali, but in the future He will honor the Way of the Sea, beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the nations:
- **Isaiah 9:2**
The people walking in darkness have seen a great light; on those living in the land of the shadow of death, a light has dawned.
- **Isaiah 9:3**
You have enlarged the nation and increased its joy. The people rejoice before You as they rejoice at harvest time, as men rejoice in dividing the plunder.
- **Isaiah 9:4**
For as in the day of Midian You have shattered the yoke of their burden, the bar across their shoulders, and the rod of their oppressor.
- **Isaiah 9:5**
For every trampling boot of battle and every garment rolled in blood will be burned as fuel for the fire.
- **Isaiah 9:6**
For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given, and the government will be upon His shoulders. And He will be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace.
- **Isaiah 9:7**
Of the increase of His government and peace there will be no end. He will reign on the throne of David and over his kingdom, to establish and sustain it with justice and righteousness from that time and forevermore. The zeal of the LORD of Hosts will accomplish this.
- **Isaiah 9:8**
The Lord has sent a message against Jacob, and it has fallen upon Israel.
- **Isaiah 9:9**
All the people will know it—Ephraim and the dwellers of Samaria. With pride and arrogance of heart they will say:
- **Isaiah 9:10**
“The bricks have fallen, but we will rebuild with finished stone; the sycamores have been felled, but we will replace them with cedars.”
- **Isaiah 9:11**
The LORD has raised up the foes of Rezin against him and joined his enemies together.
- **Isaiah 9:12**
Aram from the east and Philistia from the west have devoured Israel with open mouths. Despite all this, His anger is not turned away; His hand is still upraised.
- **Isaiah 9:13**
But the people did not return to Him who struck them; they did not seek the LORD of Hosts.
- **Isaiah 9:14**
So the LORD will cut off Israel’s head and tail, both palm branch and reed in a single day.
- **Isaiah 9:15**
The head is the elder and honorable man, and the tail is the prophet who teaches lies.
- **Isaiah 9:16**
For those who guide this people mislead them, and those they mislead are swallowed up.
- **Isaiah 9:17**
Therefore the Lord takes no pleasure in their young men; He has no compassion on their fatherless and widows. For every one of them is godless and wicked, and every mouth speaks folly. Despite all this, His anger is not turned away; His hand is still upraised.
- **Isaiah 9:18**
For wickedness burns like a fire that consumes the thorns and briers and kindles the forest thickets which roll upward in billows of smoke.
- **Isaiah 9:19**
By the wrath of the LORD of Hosts the land is scorched, and the people are fuel for the fire. No man even spares his brother.
- **Isaiah 9:20**
They carve out what is on the right, but they are still hungry; they eat what is on the left, but they are still not satisfied. Each one devours the flesh of his own offspring.
- **Isaiah 9:21**
Manasseh devours Ephraim, and Ephraim Manasseh; together they turn against Judah. Despite all this, His anger is not turned away; His hand is still upraised.
- **Isaiah 10:1**
Woe to those who enact unjust statutes and issue oppressive decrees,
- **Isaiah 10:2**
to deprive the poor of fair treatment and withhold justice from the oppressed of My people, to make widows their prey and orphans their plunder.
- **Isaiah 10:3**
What will you do on the day of reckoning when devastation comes from afar? To whom will you flee for help? Where will you leave your wealth?
- **Isaiah 10:4**
Nothing will remain but to crouch among the captives or fall among the slain. Despite all this, His anger is not turned away; His hand is still upraised.
- **Isaiah 10:5**
Woe to Assyria, the rod of My anger; the staff in their hands is My wrath.
- **Isaiah 10:6**
I will send him against a godless nation; I will dispatch him against a people destined for My rage, to take spoils and seize plunder, and to trample them down like clay in the streets.
- **Isaiah 10:7**
But this is not his intention; this is not his plan. For it is in his heart to destroy and cut off many nations.
- **Isaiah 10:8**
“Are not all my commanders kings?” he says.
- **Isaiah 10:9**
“Is not Calno like Carchemish? Is not Hamath like Arpad? Is not Samaria like Damascus?
- **Isaiah 10:10**
As my hand seized the idolatrous kingdoms whose images surpassed those of Jerusalem and Samaria,
- **Isaiah 10:11**
and as I have done to Samaria and its idols, will I not also do to Jerusalem and her idols?”
- **Isaiah 10:12**
So when the Lord has completed all His work against Mount Zion and Jerusalem, He will say, “I will punish the king of Assyria for the fruit of his arrogant heart and the proud look in his eyes.
- **Isaiah 10:13**
For he says: ‘By the strength of my hand I have done this, and by my wisdom, for I am clever. I have removed the boundaries of nations and plundered their treasures; like a mighty one I subdued their rulers.
- **Isaiah 10:14**
My hand reached as into a nest to seize the wealth of the nations. Like one gathering abandoned eggs, I gathered all the earth. No wing fluttered, no beak opened or chirped.’”
- **Isaiah 10:15**
Does an axe raise itself above the one who swings it? Does a saw boast over him who saws with it? It would be like a rod waving the one who lifts it, or a staff lifting him who is not wood!
- **Isaiah 10:16**
Therefore the Lord GOD of Hosts will send a wasting disease among Assyria’s stout warriors, and under his pomp will be kindled a fire like a burning flame.
- **Isaiah 10:17**
And the Light of Israel will become a fire, and its Holy One a flame. In a single day it will burn and devour Assyria’s thorns and thistles.
- **Isaiah 10:18**
The splendor of its forests and orchards, both soul and body, it will completely destroy, as a sickness consumes a man.
- **Isaiah 10:19**
The remaining trees of its forests will be so few that a child could count them.
- **Isaiah 10:20**
On that day the remnant of Israel and the survivors of the house of Jacob will no longer depend on him who struck them, but they will truly rely on the LORD, the Holy One of Israel.
- **Isaiah 10:21**
A remnant will return—a remnant of Jacob—to the Mighty God.
- **Isaiah 10:22**
Though your people, O Israel, be like the sand of the sea, only a remnant will return. Destruction has been decreed, overflowing with righteousness.
- **Isaiah 10:23**
For the Lord GOD of Hosts will carry out the destruction decreed upon the whole land.
- **Isaiah 10:24**
Therefore this is what the Lord GOD of Hosts says: “O My people who dwell in Zion, do not fear Assyria, who strikes you with a rod and lifts his staff against you as the Egyptians did.
- **Isaiah 10:25**
For in just a little while My fury against you will subside, and My anger will turn to their destruction.”
- **Isaiah 10:26**
And the LORD of Hosts will brandish a whip against them, as when He struck Midian at the rock of Oreb. He will raise His staff over the sea, as He did in Egypt.
- **Isaiah 10:27**
On that day the burden will be lifted from your shoulders, and the yoke from your neck. The yoke will be broken because your neck will be too large.
- **Isaiah 10:28**
Assyria has entered Aiath and passed through Migron, storing their supplies at Michmash.
- **Isaiah 10:29**
They have crossed at the ford: “We will spend the night at Geba.” Ramah trembles; Gibeah of Saul flees.
- **Isaiah 10:30**
Cry aloud, O Daughter of Gallim! Listen, O Laishah! O wretched Anathoth!
- **Isaiah 10:31**
Madmenah flees; the people of Gebim take refuge.
- **Isaiah 10:32**
Yet today they will halt at Nob, shaking a fist at the mount of Daughter Zion, at the hill of Jerusalem.
- **Isaiah 10:33**
Behold, the Lord GOD of Hosts will lop off the branches with terrifying power. The tall trees will be cut down, the lofty ones will be felled.
- **Isaiah 10:34**
He will clear the forest thickets with an axe, and Lebanon will fall before the Mighty One.
- **Isaiah 11:1**
Then a shoot will spring up from the stump of Jesse, and a Branch from his roots will bear fruit.
- **Isaiah 11:2**
The Spirit of the LORD will rest on Him—the Spirit of wisdom and understanding, the Spirit of counsel and strength, the Spirit of knowledge and fear of the LORD.
- **Isaiah 11:3**
And He will delight in the fear of the LORD. He will not judge by what His eyes see, and He will not decide by what His ears hear,
- **Isaiah 11:4**
but with righteousness He will judge the poor, and with equity He will decide for the lowly of the earth. He will strike the earth with the rod of His mouth and slay the wicked with the breath of His lips.
- **Isaiah 11:5**
Righteousness will be the belt around His hips, and faithfulness the sash around His waist.
- **Isaiah 11:6**
The wolf will live with the lamb, and the leopard will lie down with the goat; the calf and young lion and fatling will be together, and a little child will lead them.
- **Isaiah 11:7**
The cow will graze with the bear, their young will lie down together, and the lion will eat straw like the ox.
- **Isaiah 11:8**
The infant will play by the cobra’s den, and the toddler will reach into the viper’s nest.
- **Isaiah 11:9**
They will neither harm nor destroy on all My holy mountain, for the earth will be full of the knowledge of the LORD as the sea is full of water.
- **Isaiah 11:10**
On that day the Root of Jesse will stand as a banner for the peoples. The nations will seek Him, and His place of rest will be glorious.
- **Isaiah 11:11**
On that day the Lord will extend His hand a second time to recover the remnant of His people from Assyria, from Egypt, from Pathros, from Cush, from Elam, from Shinar, from Hamath, and from the islands of the sea.
- **Isaiah 11:12**
He will raise a banner for the nations and gather the exiles of Israel; He will collect the scattered of Judah from the four corners of the earth.
- **Isaiah 11:13**
Then the jealousy of Ephraim will depart, and the adversaries of Judah will be cut off. Ephraim will no longer envy Judah, nor will Judah harass Ephraim.
- **Isaiah 11:14**
They will swoop down on the slopes of the Philistines to the west; together they will plunder the sons of the east. They will lay their hands on Edom and Moab, and the Ammonites will be subject to them.
- **Isaiah 11:15**
The LORD will devote to destruction the gulf of the Sea of Egypt; with a scorching wind He will sweep His hand over the Euphrates. He will split it into seven streams for men to cross with dry sandals.
- **Isaiah 11:16**
There will be a highway for the remnant of His people who remain from Assyria, as there was for Israel when they came up from the land of Egypt.
- **Isaiah 12:1**
In that day you will say: “O LORD, I will praise You. Although You were angry with me, Your anger has turned away, and You have comforted me.
- **Isaiah 12:2**
Surely God is my salvation; I will trust and not be afraid. For the LORD GOD is my strength and my song, and He also has become my salvation.”
- **Isaiah 12:3**
With joy you will draw water from the springs of salvation,
- **Isaiah 12:4**
and on that day you will say: “Give praise to the LORD; proclaim His name! Make His works known among the peoples; declare that His name is exalted.
- **Isaiah 12:5**
Sing to the LORD, for He has done glorious things. Let this be known in all the earth.
- **Isaiah 12:6**
Cry out and sing, O citizen of Zion, for great among you is the Holy One of Israel.”
- **Isaiah 13:1**
This is the burden against Babylon that Isaiah son of Amoz received:
- **Isaiah 13:2**
Raise a banner on a barren hilltop; call aloud to them. Wave your hand, that they may enter the gates of the nobles.
- **Isaiah 13:3**
I have commanded My sanctified ones; I have even summoned My warriors to execute My wrath and exult in My triumph.
- **Isaiah 13:4**
Listen, a tumult on the mountains, like that of a great multitude! Listen, an uproar among the kingdoms, like nations gathered together! The LORD of Hosts is mobilizing an army for war.
- **Isaiah 13:5**
They are coming from faraway lands, from the ends of the heavens—the LORD and the weapons of His wrath—to destroy the whole country.
- **Isaiah 13:6**
Wail, for the Day of the LORD is near; it will come as destruction from the Almighty.
- **Isaiah 13:7**
Therefore all hands will fall limp, and every man’s heart will melt.
- **Isaiah 13:8**
Terror, pain, and anguish will seize them; they will writhe like a woman in labor. They will look at one another, their faces flushed with fear.
- **Isaiah 13:9**
Behold, the Day of the LORD is coming—cruel, with fury and burning anger—to make the earth a desolation and to destroy the sinners within it.
- **Isaiah 13:10**
For the stars of heaven and their constellations will not give their light. The rising sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light.
- **Isaiah 13:11**
I will punish the world for its evil and the wicked for their iniquity. I will end the haughtiness of the arrogant and lay low the pride of the ruthless.
- **Isaiah 13:12**
I will make man scarcer than pure gold, and mankind rarer than the gold of Ophir.
- **Isaiah 13:13**
Therefore I will make the heavens tremble, and the earth will be shaken from its place at the wrath of the LORD of Hosts on the day of His burning anger.
- **Isaiah 13:14**
Like a hunted gazelle, like a sheep without a shepherd, each will return to his own people, each will flee to his native land.
- **Isaiah 13:15**
Whoever is caught will be stabbed, and whoever is captured will die by the sword.
- **Isaiah 13:16**
Their infants will be dashed to pieces before their eyes, their houses will be looted, and their wives will be ravished.
- **Isaiah 13:17**
Behold, I will stir up against them the Medes, who have no regard for silver and no desire for gold.
- **Isaiah 13:18**
Their bows will dash young men to pieces; they will have no mercy on the fruit of the womb; they will not look with pity on the children.
- **Isaiah 13:19**
And Babylon, the jewel of the kingdoms, the glory of the pride of the Chaldeans, will be overthrown by God like Sodom and Gomorrah.
- **Isaiah 13:20**
She will never be inhabited or settled from generation to generation; no nomad will pitch his tent there, no shepherd will rest his flock there.
- **Isaiah 13:21**
But desert creatures will lie down there, and howling creatures will fill her houses. Ostriches will dwell there, and wild goats will leap about.
- **Isaiah 13:22**
Hyenas will howl in her fortresses and jackals in her luxurious palaces. Babylon’s time is at hand, and her days will not be prolonged.
- **Isaiah 14:1**
For the LORD will have compassion on Jacob; once again He will choose Israel and settle them in their own land. The foreigner will join them and unite with the house of Jacob.
- **Isaiah 14:2**
The nations will escort Israel and bring it to its homeland. Then the house of Israel will possess the nations as menservants and maidservants in the LORD’s land. They will make captives of their captors and rule over their oppressors.
- **Isaiah 14:3**
On the day that the LORD gives you rest from your pain and torment, and from the hard labor into which you were forced,
- **Isaiah 14:4**
you will sing this song of contempt against the king of Babylon: How the oppressor has ceased, and how his fury has ended!
- **Isaiah 14:5**
The LORD has broken the staff of the wicked, the scepter of the rulers.
- **Isaiah 14:6**
It struck the peoples in anger with unceasing blows; it subdued the nations in rage with relentless persecution.
- **Isaiah 14:7**
All the earth is at peace and at rest; they break out in song.
- **Isaiah 14:8**
Even the cypresses and cedars of Lebanon exult over you: “Since you have been laid low, no woodcutter comes against us.”
- **Isaiah 14:9**
Sheol beneath is eager to meet you upon your arrival. It stirs the spirits of the dead to greet you—all the rulers of the earth. It makes all the kings of the nations rise from their thrones.
- **Isaiah 14:10**
They will all respond to you, saying, “You too have become weak, as we are; you have become like us!”
- **Isaiah 14:11**
Your pomp has been brought down to Sheol, along with the music of your harps. Maggots are your bed and worms your blanket.
- **Isaiah 14:12**
How you have fallen from heaven, O day star, son of the dawn! You have been cut down to the ground, O destroyer of nations.
- **Isaiah 14:13**
You said in your heart: “I will ascend to the heavens; I will raise my throne above the stars of God. I will sit on the mount of assembly, in the far reaches of the north.
- **Isaiah 14:14**
I will ascend above the tops of the clouds; I will make myself like the Most High.”
- **Isaiah 14:15**
But you will be brought down to Sheol, to the lowest depths of the Pit.
- **Isaiah 14:16**
Those who see you will stare; they will ponder your fate: “Is this the man who shook the earth and made the kingdoms tremble,
- **Isaiah 14:17**
who turned the world into a desert and destroyed its cities, who refused to let the captives return to their homes?”
- **Isaiah 14:18**
All the kings of the nations lie in state, each in his own tomb.
- **Isaiah 14:19**
But you are cast out of your grave like a rejected branch, covered by those slain with the sword, and dumped into a rocky pit like a carcass trampled underfoot.
- **Isaiah 14:20**
You will not join them in burial, since you have destroyed your land and slaughtered your own people. The offspring of the wicked will never again be mentioned.
- **Isaiah 14:21**
Prepare a place to slaughter his sons for the iniquities of their forefathers. They will never rise up to possess a land or cover the earth with their cities.
- **Isaiah 14:22**
“I will rise up against them,” declares the LORD of Hosts. “I will cut off from Babylon her name and her remnant, her offspring and her posterity,” declares the LORD.
- **Isaiah 14:23**
“I will make her a place for owls and for swamplands; I will sweep her away with the broom of destruction,” declares the LORD of Hosts.
- **Isaiah 14:24**
The LORD of Hosts has sworn: “Surely, as I have planned, so will it be; as I have purposed, so will it stand.
- **Isaiah 14:25**
I will break Assyria in My land; I will trample him on My mountain. His yoke will be taken off My people, and his burden removed from their shoulders.”
- **Isaiah 14:26**
This is the plan devised for the whole earth, and this is the hand stretched out over all the nations.
- **Isaiah 14:27**
The LORD of Hosts has purposed, and who can thwart Him? His hand is outstretched, so who can turn it back?
- **Isaiah 14:28**
In the year that King Ahaz died, this burden was received:
- **Isaiah 14:29**
Do not rejoice, all you Philistines, that the rod that struck you is broken. For a viper will spring from the root of the snake, and a flying serpent from its egg.
- **Isaiah 14:30**
Then the firstborn of the poor will find pasture, and the needy will lie down in safety, but I will kill your root by famine, and your remnant will be slain.
- **Isaiah 14:31**
Wail, O gate! Cry out, O city! Melt away, all you Philistines! For a cloud of smoke comes from the north, and there are no stragglers in its ranks.
- **Isaiah 14:32**
What answer will be given to the envoys of that nation? “The LORD has founded Zion, where His afflicted people will find refuge.”
- **Isaiah 15:1**
This is the burden against Moab: Ar in Moab is ruined, destroyed in a night! Kir in Moab is devastated, destroyed in a night!
- **Isaiah 15:2**
Dibon goes up to its temple to weep at its high places. Moab wails over Nebo, as well as over Medeba. Every head is shaved, every beard is cut off.
- **Isaiah 15:3**
In its streets they wear sackcloth; on the rooftops and in the public squares they all wail, falling down weeping.
- **Isaiah 15:4**
Heshbon and Elealeh cry out; their voices are heard as far as Jahaz. Therefore the soldiers of Moab cry out; their souls tremble within.
- **Isaiah 15:5**
My heart cries out over Moab; her fugitives flee as far as Zoar, as far as Eglath-shelishiyah. With weeping they ascend the slope of Luhith; they lament their destruction on the road to Horonaim.
- **Isaiah 15:6**
The waters of Nimrim are dried up, and the grass is withered; the vegetation is gone, and the greenery is no more.
- **Isaiah 15:7**
So they carry their wealth and belongings over the Brook of the Willows.
- **Isaiah 15:8**
For their outcry echoes to the border of Moab. Their wailing reaches Eglaim; it is heard in Beer-elim.
- **Isaiah 15:9**
The waters of Dimon are full of blood, but I will bring more upon Dimon—a lion upon the fugitives of Moab and upon the remnant of the land.
- **Isaiah 16:1**
Send the tribute lambs to the ruler of the land, from Sela in the desert to the mount of Daughter Zion.
- **Isaiah 16:2**
Like fluttering birds pushed out of the nest, so are the daughters of Moab at the fords of the Arnon:
- **Isaiah 16:3**
“Give us counsel; render a decision. Shelter us at noonday with shade as dark as night. Hide the refugees; do not betray the one who flees.
- **Isaiah 16:4**
Let my fugitives stay with you; be a refuge for Moab from the destroyer.” When the oppressor has gone, destruction has ceased, and the oppressors have vanished from the land,
- **Isaiah 16:5**
in loving devotion a throne will be established in the tent of David. A judge seeking justice and hastening righteousness will sit on it in faithfulness.
- **Isaiah 16:6**
We have heard of Moab’s pomposity, his exceeding pride and conceit, his overflowing arrogance. But his boasting is empty.
- **Isaiah 16:7**
Therefore let Moab wail; let them wail together for Moab. Moan for the raisin cakes of Kir-hareseth, you who are utterly stricken.
- **Isaiah 16:8**
For the fields of Heshbon have withered, along with the grapevines of Sibmah. The rulers of the nations have trampled its choicest vines, which had reached as far as Jazer and spread toward the desert. Their shoots had spread out and passed over the sea.
- **Isaiah 16:9**
So I weep with Jazer for the vines of Sibmah; I drench Heshbon and Elealeh with my tears. Triumphant shouts have fallen silent over your summer fruit and your harvest.
- **Isaiah 16:10**
Joy and gladness are removed from the orchard; no one sings or shouts in the vineyards. No one tramples the grapes in the winepresses; I have put an end to the cheering.
- **Isaiah 16:11**
Therefore my heart laments for Moab like a harp, my inmost being for Kir-heres.
- **Isaiah 16:12**
When Moab appears on the high place, when he wearies himself and enters his sanctuary to pray, it will do him no good.
- **Isaiah 16:13**
This is the message that the LORD spoke earlier concerning Moab.
- **Isaiah 16:14**
And now the LORD says, “In three years, as a hired worker counts the years, Moab’s splendor will become an object of contempt, with all her many people. And those who are left will be few and feeble.”
- **Isaiah 17:1**
This is the burden against Damascus: “Behold, Damascus is no longer a city; it has become a heap of ruins.
- **Isaiah 17:2**
The cities of Aroer are forsaken; they will be left to the flocks, which will lie down with no one to fear.
- **Isaiah 17:3**
The fortress will disappear from Ephraim, and the sovereignty from Damascus. The remnant of Aram will be like the splendor of the Israelites,” declares the LORD of Hosts.
- **Isaiah 17:4**
“In that day the splendor of Jacob will fade, and the fat of his body will waste away,
- **Isaiah 17:5**
as the reaper gathers the standing grain and harvests the ears with his arm, as one gleans heads of grain in the Valley of Rephaim.
- **Isaiah 17:6**
Yet gleanings will remain, like an olive tree that has been beaten—two or three berries atop the tree, four or five on its fruitful branches,” declares the LORD, the God of Israel.
- **Isaiah 17:7**
In that day men will look to their Maker and turn their eyes to the Holy One of Israel.
- **Isaiah 17:8**
They will not look to the altars they have fashioned with their hands or to the Asherahs and incense altars they have made with their fingers.
- **Isaiah 17:9**
In that day their strong cities will be like forsaken thickets and summits, abandoned to the Israelites and to utter desolation.
- **Isaiah 17:10**
For you have forgotten the God of your salvation and failed to remember the Rock of your refuge. Therefore, though you cultivate delightful plots and set out cuttings from exotic vines—
- **Isaiah 17:11**
though on the day you plant you make them grow, and on that morning you help your seed sprout—yet the harvest will vanish on the day of disease and incurable pain.
- **Isaiah 17:12**
Alas, the tumult of many peoples; they rage like the roaring seas and clamoring nations; they rumble like the crashing of mighty waters.
- **Isaiah 17:13**
The nations rage like the rush of many waters. He rebukes them, and they flee far away, driven before the wind like chaff on the hills, like tumbleweeds before a gale.
- **Isaiah 17:14**
In the evening, there is sudden terror! Before morning, they are no more! This is the portion of those who loot us and the lot of those who plunder us.
- **Isaiah 18:1**
Woe to the land of whirring wings, along the rivers of Cush,
- **Isaiah 18:2**
which sends couriers by sea, in papyrus vessels on the waters. Go, swift messengers, to a people tall and smooth-skinned, to a people widely feared, to a powerful nation of strange speech, whose land is divided by rivers.
- **Isaiah 18:3**
All you people of the world and dwellers of the earth, when a banner is raised on the mountains, you will see it; when a ram’s horn sounds, you will hear it.
- **Isaiah 18:4**
For this is what the LORD has told me: “I will quietly look on from My dwelling place, like shimmering heat in the sunshine, like a cloud of dew in the heat of harvest.”
- **Isaiah 18:5**
For before the harvest, when the blossom is gone and the flower becomes a ripening grape, He will cut off the shoots with a pruning knife and remove and discard the branches.
- **Isaiah 18:6**
They will all be left to the mountain birds of prey, and to the beasts of the land. The birds will feed on them in summer, and all the wild animals in winter.
- **Isaiah 18:7**
At that time gifts will be brought to the LORD of Hosts—from a people tall and smooth-skinned, from a people widely feared, from a powerful nation of strange speech, whose land is divided by rivers—to Mount Zion, the place of the Name of the LORD of Hosts.
- **Isaiah 19:1**
This is the burden against Egypt: Behold, the LORD rides on a swift cloud; He is coming to Egypt. The idols of Egypt will tremble before Him, and the hearts of the Egyptians will melt within them.
- **Isaiah 19:2**
“So I will incite Egyptian against Egyptian; brother will fight against brother, neighbor against neighbor, city against city, and kingdom against kingdom.
- **Isaiah 19:3**
Then the spirit of the Egyptians will be emptied out from among them, and I will frustrate their plans, so that they will resort to idols and spirits of the dead, to mediums and spiritists.
- **Isaiah 19:4**
I will deliver the Egyptians into the hands of harsh masters, and a fierce king will rule over them,” declares the Lord GOD of Hosts.
- **Isaiah 19:5**
The waters of the Nile will dry up, and the riverbed will be parched and empty.
- **Isaiah 19:6**
The canals will stink; the streams of Egypt will trickle and dry up; the reeds and rushes will wither.
- **Isaiah 19:7**
The bulrushes by the Nile, by the mouth of the river, and all the fields sown along the Nile, will wither, blow away, and be no more.
- **Isaiah 19:8**
Then the fishermen will mourn, all who cast a hook into the Nile will lament, and those who spread nets on the waters will pine away.
- **Isaiah 19:9**
The workers in flax will be dismayed, and the weavers of fine linen will turn pale.
- **Isaiah 19:10**
The workers in cloth will be dejected, and all the hired workers will be sick at heart.
- **Isaiah 19:11**
The princes of Zoan are mere fools; Pharaoh’s wise counselors give senseless advice. How can you say to Pharaoh, “I am one of the wise, a son of eastern kings”?
- **Isaiah 19:12**
Where are your wise men now? Let them tell you and reveal what the LORD of Hosts has planned against Egypt.
- **Isaiah 19:13**
The princes of Zoan have become fools; the princes of Memphis are deceived. The cornerstones of her tribes have led Egypt astray.
- **Isaiah 19:14**
The LORD has poured into her a spirit of confusion. Egypt has been led astray in all she does, as a drunkard staggers through his own vomit.
- **Isaiah 19:15**
There is nothing Egypt can do—head or tail, palm or reed.
- **Isaiah 19:16**
In that day the Egyptians will be like women. They will tremble with fear beneath the uplifted hand of the LORD of Hosts, when He brandishes it against them.
- **Isaiah 19:17**
The land of Judah will bring terror to Egypt; whenever Judah is mentioned, Egypt will tremble over what the LORD of Hosts has planned against it.
- **Isaiah 19:18**
In that day five cities in the land of Egypt will speak the language of Canaan and swear allegiance to the LORD of Hosts. One of them will be called the City of the Sun.
- **Isaiah 19:19**
In that day there will be an altar to the LORD in the center of the land of Egypt, and a pillar to the LORD near her border.
- **Isaiah 19:20**
It will be a sign and a witness to the LORD of Hosts in the land of Egypt. When they cry out to the LORD because of their oppressors, He will send them a savior and defender to rescue them.
- **Isaiah 19:21**
The LORD will make Himself known to Egypt, and on that day Egypt will acknowledge the LORD. They will worship with sacrifices and offerings; they will make vows to the LORD and fulfill them.
- **Isaiah 19:22**
And the LORD will strike Egypt with a plague; He will strike them but heal them. They will turn to the LORD, and He will hear their prayers and heal them.
- **Isaiah 19:23**
In that day there will be a highway from Egypt to Assyria. The Assyrians will go to Egypt, and the Egyptians to Assyria. The Egyptians and Assyrians will worship together.
- **Isaiah 19:24**
In that day Israel will join a three-party alliance with Egypt and Assyria—a blessing upon the earth.
- **Isaiah 19:25**
The LORD of Hosts will bless them, saying, “Blessed be Egypt My people, Assyria My handiwork, and Israel My inheritance.”
- **Isaiah 20:1**
Before the year that the chief commander, sent by Sargon king of Assyria, came to Ashdod and attacked and captured it,
- **Isaiah 20:2**
the LORD had already spoken through Isaiah son of Amoz, saying, “Go, remove the sackcloth from your waist and the sandals from your feet.” And Isaiah did so, walking around naked and barefoot.
- **Isaiah 20:3**
Then the LORD said, “Just as My servant Isaiah has gone naked and barefoot for three years as a sign and omen against Egypt and Cush,
- **Isaiah 20:4**
so the king of Assyria will lead away the captives of Egypt and the exiles of Cush, young and old alike, naked and barefoot, with bared buttocks—to Egypt’s shame.
- **Isaiah 20:5**
Those who made Cush their hope and Egypt their boast will be dismayed and ashamed.
- **Isaiah 20:6**
And on that day the dwellers of this coastland will say, ‘See what has happened to our source of hope, those to whom we fled for help and deliverance from the king of Assyria! How then can we escape?’”
- **Isaiah 21:1**
This is the burden against the Desert by the Sea: Like whirlwinds sweeping through the Negev, an invader comes from the desert, from a land of terror.
- **Isaiah 21:2**
A dire vision is declared to me: “The traitor still betrays, and the destroyer still destroys. Go up, O Elam! Lay siege, O Media! I will put an end to all her groaning.”
- **Isaiah 21:3**
Therefore my body is filled with anguish. Pain grips me, like the pains of a woman in labor. I am bewildered to hear, I am dismayed to see.
- **Isaiah 21:4**
My heart falters; fear makes me tremble. The twilight of my desire has turned to horror.
- **Isaiah 21:5**
They prepare a table, they lay out a carpet, they eat, they drink! Rise up, O princes, oil the shields!
- **Isaiah 21:6**
For this is what the Lord says to me: “Go, post a lookout and have him report what he sees.
- **Isaiah 21:7**
When he sees chariots with teams of horsemen, riders on donkeys, riders on camels, he must be alert, fully alert.”
- **Isaiah 21:8**
Then the lookout shouted: “Day after day, my lord, I stand on the watchtower; night after night I stay at my post.
- **Isaiah 21:9**
Look, here come the riders, horsemen in pairs.” And one answered, saying: “Fallen, fallen is Babylon! All the images of her gods lie shattered on the ground!”
- **Isaiah 21:10**
O my people, crushed on the threshing floor, I tell you what I have heard from the LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel.
- **Isaiah 21:11**
This is the burden against Dumah: One calls to me from Seir, “Watchman, what is left of the night? Watchman, what is left of the night?”
- **Isaiah 21:12**
The watchman replies, “Morning has come, but also the night. If you would inquire, then inquire. Come back yet again.”
- **Isaiah 21:13**
This is the burden against Arabia: In the thickets of Arabia you must lodge, O caravans of Dedanites.
- **Isaiah 21:14**
Bring water for the thirsty, O dwellers of Tema; meet the refugees with food.
- **Isaiah 21:15**
For they flee from the sword—the sword that is drawn—from the bow that is bent, and from the stress of battle.
- **Isaiah 21:16**
For this is what the Lord says to me: “Within one year, as a hired worker would count it, all the glory of Kedar will be gone.
- **Isaiah 21:17**
The remaining archers, the warriors of Kedar, will be few.” For the LORD, the God of Israel, has spoken.
- **Isaiah 22:1**
This is the burden against the Valley of Vision: What ails you now, that you have all gone up to the rooftops,
- **Isaiah 22:2**
O city of commotion, O town of revelry? Your slain did not die by the sword, nor were they killed in battle.
- **Isaiah 22:3**
All your rulers have fled together, captured without a bow. All your fugitives were captured together, having fled to a distant place.
- **Isaiah 22:4**
Therefore I said, “Turn away from me, let me weep bitterly! Do not try to console me over the destruction of the daughter of my people.”
- **Isaiah 22:5**
For the Lord GOD of Hosts has set a day of tumult and trampling and confusion in the Valley of Vision—of breaking down the walls and crying to the mountains.
- **Isaiah 22:6**
Elam takes up a quiver, with chariots and horsemen, and Kir uncovers the shield.
- **Isaiah 22:7**
Your choicest valleys are full of chariots, and horsemen are posted at the gates.
- **Isaiah 22:8**
He has uncovered the defenses of Judah. On that day you looked to the weapons in the House of the Forest.
- **Isaiah 22:9**
You saw that there were many breaches in the walls of the City of David. You collected water from the lower pool.
- **Isaiah 22:10**
You counted the houses of Jerusalem and tore them down to strengthen the wall.
- **Isaiah 22:11**
You built a reservoir between the walls for the waters of the ancient pool, but you did not look to the One who made it, or consider Him who planned it long ago.
- **Isaiah 22:12**
On that day the Lord GOD of Hosts called for weeping and wailing, for shaven heads and the wearing of sackcloth.
- **Isaiah 22:13**
But look, there is joy and gladness, butchering of cattle and slaughtering of sheep, eating of meat and drinking of wine: “Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die!”
- **Isaiah 22:14**
The LORD of Hosts has revealed in my hearing: “Until your dying day, this sin of yours will never be atoned for,” says the Lord GOD of Hosts.
- **Isaiah 22:15**
This is what the Lord GOD of Hosts says: “Go, say to Shebna, the steward in charge of the palace:
- **Isaiah 22:16**
What are you doing here, and who authorized you to carve out a tomb for yourself here—to chisel your tomb in the height and cut your resting place in the rock?
- **Isaiah 22:17**
Look, O mighty man! The LORD is about to shake you violently. He will take hold of you,
- **Isaiah 22:18**
roll you into a ball, and sling you into a wide land. There you will die, and there your glorious chariots will remain—a disgrace to the house of your master.
- **Isaiah 22:19**
I will remove you from office, and you will be ousted from your position.
- **Isaiah 22:20**
On that day I will summon My servant, Eliakim son of Hilkiah.
- **Isaiah 22:21**
I will clothe him with your robe and tie your sash around him. I will put your authority in his hand, and he will be a father to the dwellers of Jerusalem and to the house of Judah.
- **Isaiah 22:22**
I will place on his shoulder the key to the house of David. What he opens no one can shut, and what he shuts no one can open.
- **Isaiah 22:23**
I will drive him like a peg into a firm place, and he will be a throne of glory for the house of his father.
- **Isaiah 22:24**
So they will hang on him the whole burden of his father’s house: the descendants and the offshoots—all the lesser vessels, from bowls to every kind of jar.
- **Isaiah 22:25**
In that day, declares the LORD of Hosts, the peg driven into a firm place will give way; it will be sheared off and fall, and the load upon it will be cut down.” Indeed, the LORD has spoken.
- **Isaiah 23:1**
This is the burden against Tyre: Wail, O ships of Tarshish, for Tyre is laid waste, without house or harbor. Word has reached them from the land of Cyprus.
- **Isaiah 23:2**
Be silent, O dwellers of the coastland, you merchants of Sidon, whose traders have crossed the sea.
- **Isaiah 23:3**
On the great waters came the grain of Shihor; the harvest of the Nile was the revenue of Tyre; she was the merchant of the nations.
- **Isaiah 23:4**
Be ashamed, O Sidon, the stronghold of the sea, for the sea has spoken: “I have not been in labor or given birth. I have not raised young men or brought up young women.”
- **Isaiah 23:5**
When the report reaches Egypt, they will writhe in agony over the news of Tyre.
- **Isaiah 23:6**
Cross over to Tarshish; wail, O inhabitants of the coastland!
- **Isaiah 23:7**
Is this your jubilant city, whose origin is from antiquity, whose feet have taken her to settle far away?
- **Isaiah 23:8**
Who planned this against Tyre, the bestower of crowns, whose traders are princes, whose merchants are renowned on the earth?
- **Isaiah 23:9**
The LORD of Hosts planned it, to defile all its glorious beauty, to disgrace all the renowned of the earth.
- **Isaiah 23:10**
Cultivate your land like the Nile, O Daughter of Tarshish; there is no longer a harbor.
- **Isaiah 23:11**
The LORD has stretched out His hand over the sea; He has made kingdoms tremble. He has given a command that the strongholds of Canaan be destroyed.
- **Isaiah 23:12**
He said, “You shall rejoice no more, O oppressed Virgin Daughter of Sidon. Get up and cross over to Cyprus—even there you will find no rest.”
- **Isaiah 23:13**
Look at the land of the Chaldeans—a people now of no account. The Assyrians destined it for the desert creatures; they set up their siege towers and stripped its palaces. They brought it to ruin.
- **Isaiah 23:14**
Wail, O ships of Tarshish, for your harbor has been destroyed!
- **Isaiah 23:15**
At that time Tyre will be forgotten for seventy years—the span of a king’s life. But at the end of seventy years, it will happen to Tyre as in the song of the harlot:
- **Isaiah 23:16**
“Take up your harp, stroll through the city, O forgotten harlot. Make sweet melody, sing many a song, so you will be remembered.”
- **Isaiah 23:17**
And at the end of seventy years, the LORD will restore Tyre. Then she will return to hire as a prostitute and sell herself to all the kingdoms on the face of the earth.
- **Isaiah 23:18**
Yet her profits and wages will be set apart to the LORD; they will not be stored or saved, for her profit will go to those who live before the LORD, for abundant food and fine clothing.
- **Isaiah 24:1**
Behold, the LORD lays waste the earth and leaves it in ruins. He will twist its surface and scatter its inhabitants—
- **Isaiah 24:2**
people and priest alike, servant and master, maid and mistress, buyer and seller, lender and borrower, creditor and debtor.
- **Isaiah 24:3**
The earth will be utterly laid waste and thoroughly plundered. For the LORD has spoken this word.
- **Isaiah 24:4**
The earth mourns and withers; the world languishes and fades; the exalted of the earth waste away.
- **Isaiah 24:5**
The earth is defiled by its people; they have transgressed the laws; they have overstepped the decrees and broken the everlasting covenant.
- **Isaiah 24:6**
Therefore a curse has consumed the earth, and its inhabitants must bear the guilt; the earth’s dwellers have been burned, and only a few survive.
- **Isaiah 24:7**
The new wine dries up, the vine withers. All the merrymakers now groan.
- **Isaiah 24:8**
The joyful tambourines have ceased; the noise of revelers has stopped; the joyful harp is silent.
- **Isaiah 24:9**
They no longer sing and drink wine; strong drink is bitter to those who consume it.
- **Isaiah 24:10**
The city of chaos is shattered; every house is closed to entry.
- **Isaiah 24:11**
In the streets they cry out for wine. All joy turns to gloom; rejoicing is exiled from the land.
- **Isaiah 24:12**
The city is left in ruins; its gate is reduced to rubble.
- **Isaiah 24:13**
So will it be on the earth and among the nations, like a harvested olive tree, like a gleaning after a grape harvest.
- **Isaiah 24:14**
They raise their voices, they shout for joy; from the west they proclaim the majesty of the LORD.
- **Isaiah 24:15**
Therefore glorify the LORD in the east. Extol the name of the LORD, the God of Israel in the islands of the sea.
- **Isaiah 24:16**
From the ends of the earth we hear singing: “Glory to the Righteous One.” But I said, “I am wasting away! I am wasting away! Woe is me.” The treacherous betray; the treacherous deal in treachery.
- **Isaiah 24:17**
Terror and pit and snare await you, O dweller of the earth.
- **Isaiah 24:18**
Whoever flees the sound of panic will fall into the pit, and whoever climbs from the pit will be caught in the snare. For the windows of heaven are open, and the foundations of the earth are shaken.
- **Isaiah 24:19**
The earth is utterly broken apart, the earth is split open, the earth is shaken violently.
- **Isaiah 24:20**
The earth staggers like a drunkard and sways like a shack. Earth’s rebellion weighs it down, and it falls, never to rise again.
- **Isaiah 24:21**
In that day the LORD will punish the host of heaven above and the kings of the earth below.
- **Isaiah 24:22**
They will be gathered together like prisoners in a pit. They will be confined to a dungeon and punished after many days.
- **Isaiah 24:23**
The moon will be confounded and the sun will be ashamed; for the LORD of Hosts will reign on Mount Zion and in Jerusalem, and before His elders with great glory.
- **Isaiah 25:1**
O LORD, You are my God! I will exalt You; I will praise Your name. For You have worked wonders—plans formed long ago—in perfect faithfulness.
- **Isaiah 25:2**
Indeed, You have made the city a heap of rubble, the fortified town a ruin. The fortress of strangers is a city no more; it will never be rebuilt.
- **Isaiah 25:3**
Therefore, a strong people will honor You. The cities of ruthless nations will revere You.
- **Isaiah 25:4**
For You have been a refuge for the poor, a stronghold for the needy in distress, a refuge from the storm, a shade from the heat. For the breath of the ruthless is like rain against a wall,
- **Isaiah 25:5**
like heat in a dry land. You subdue the uproar of foreigners. As the shade of a cloud cools the heat, so the song of the ruthless is silenced.
- **Isaiah 25:6**
On this mountain the LORD of Hosts will prepare a banquet for all the peoples, a feast of aged wine, of choice meat, of finely aged wine.
- **Isaiah 25:7**
On this mountain He will swallow up the shroud that enfolds all peoples, the sheet that covers all nations;
- **Isaiah 25:8**
He will swallow up death forever. The Lord GOD will wipe away the tears from every face and remove the disgrace of His people from the whole earth. For the LORD has spoken.
- **Isaiah 25:9**
And in that day it will be said, “Surely this is our God; we have waited for Him, and He has saved us. This is the LORD for whom we have waited. Let us rejoice and be glad in His salvation.”
- **Isaiah 25:10**
For the hand of the LORD will rest on this mountain. But Moab will be trampled in his place as straw is trodden into the dung pile.
- **Isaiah 25:11**
He will spread out his hands within it, as a swimmer spreads his arms to swim. His pride will be brought low, despite the skill of his hands.
- **Isaiah 25:12**
The high-walled fortress will be brought down, cast to the ground, into the dust.
- **Isaiah 26:1**
In that day this song will be sung in the land of Judah: We have a strong city; salvation is established as its walls and ramparts.
- **Isaiah 26:2**
Open the gates so a righteous nation may enter—one that remains faithful.
- **Isaiah 26:3**
You will keep in perfect peace the steadfast of mind, because he trusts in You.
- **Isaiah 26:4**
Trust in the LORD forever, because GOD the LORD is the Rock eternal.
- **Isaiah 26:5**
For He has humbled those who dwell on high; He lays the lofty city low. He brings it down to the ground; He casts it into the dust.
- **Isaiah 26:6**
Feet trample it down—the feet of the oppressed, the steps of the poor.
- **Isaiah 26:7**
The path of the righteous is level; You clear a straight path for the upright.
- **Isaiah 26:8**
Yes, we wait for You, O LORD; we walk in the path of Your judgments. Your name and renown are the desire of our souls.
- **Isaiah 26:9**
My soul longs for You in the night; indeed, my spirit seeks You at dawn. For when Your judgments come upon the earth, the people of the world learn righteousness.
- **Isaiah 26:10**
Though grace is shown to the wicked man, he does not learn righteousness. In the land of righteousness he acts unjustly and fails to see the majesty of the LORD.
- **Isaiah 26:11**
O LORD, Your hand is upraised, but they do not see it. They will see Your zeal for Your people and be put to shame. The fire set for Your enemies will consume them!
- **Isaiah 26:12**
O LORD, You will establish peace for us. For all that we have accomplished, You have done for us.
- **Isaiah 26:13**
O LORD our God, other lords besides You have had dominion, but Your name alone do we confess.
- **Isaiah 26:14**
The dead will not live; the departed spirits will not rise. Therefore You have punished and destroyed them; You have wiped out all memory of them.
- **Isaiah 26:15**
You have enlarged the nation, O LORD; You have enlarged the nation. You have gained glory for Yourself; You have extended all the borders of the land.
- **Isaiah 26:16**
O LORD, they sought You in their distress; when You disciplined them, they poured out a quiet prayer.
- **Isaiah 26:17**
As a woman with child about to give birth writhes and cries out in pain, so were we in Your presence, O LORD.
- **Isaiah 26:18**
We were with child; we writhed in pain; but we gave birth to wind. We have given no salvation to the earth, nor brought any life into the world.
- **Isaiah 26:19**
Your dead will live; their bodies will rise. Awake and sing, you who dwell in the dust! For your dew is like the dew of the morning, and the earth will bring forth her dead.
- **Isaiah 26:20**
Go, my people, enter your rooms and shut your doors behind you. Hide yourselves a little while until the wrath has passed.
- **Isaiah 26:21**
For behold, the LORD is coming out of His dwelling to punish the inhabitants of the earth for their iniquity. The earth will reveal her bloodshed and will no longer conceal her slain.
- **Isaiah 27:1**
In that day the LORD will take His sharp, great, and mighty sword, and bring judgment on Leviathan the fleeing serpent—Leviathan the coiling serpent—and He will slay the dragon of the sea.
- **Isaiah 27:2**
In that day: “Sing about a fruitful vineyard.
- **Isaiah 27:3**
I, the LORD, am its keeper; I water it continually. I guard it night and day so no one can disturb it;
- **Isaiah 27:4**
I am not angry. If only thorns and briers confronted Me, I would march and trample them, I would burn them to the ground.
- **Isaiah 27:5**
Or let them lay claim to My protection; let them make peace with Me—yes, let them make peace with Me.”
- **Isaiah 27:6**
In the days to come, Jacob will take root. Israel will bud and blossom and fill the whole world with fruit.
- **Isaiah 27:7**
Has the LORD struck Israel as He struck her oppressors? Was she killed like those who slayed her?
- **Isaiah 27:8**
By warfare and exile You contended with her and removed her with a fierce wind, as on the day the east wind blows.
- **Isaiah 27:9**
Therefore Jacob’s guilt will be atoned for, and the full fruit of the removal of his sin will be this: When he makes all the altar stones like crushed bits of chalk, no Asherah poles or incense altars will remain standing.
- **Isaiah 27:10**
For the fortified city lies deserted—a homestead abandoned, a wilderness forsaken. There the calves graze, and there they lie down; they strip its branches bare.
- **Isaiah 27:11**
When its limbs are dry, they are broken off. Women come and use them for kindling; for this is a people without understanding. Therefore their Maker has no compassion on them, and their Creator shows them no favor.
- **Isaiah 27:12**
In that day the LORD will thresh from the flowing Euphrates to the Wadi of Egypt, and you, O Israelites, will be gathered one by one.
- **Isaiah 27:13**
And in that day a great ram’s horn will sound, and those who were perishing in Assyria will come forth with those who were exiles in Egypt. And they will worship the LORD on the holy mountain in Jerusalem.
- **Isaiah 28:1**
Woe to the majestic crown of Ephraim’s drunkards, to the fading flower of his glorious splendor, set on the summit above the fertile valley, the pride of those overcome by wine.
- **Isaiah 28:2**
Behold, the Lord has one who is strong and mighty. Like a hailstorm or destructive tempest, like a driving rain or flooding downpour, he will smash that crown to the ground.
- **Isaiah 28:3**
The majestic crown of Ephraim’s drunkards will be trampled underfoot.
- **Isaiah 28:4**
The fading flower of his beautiful splendor, set on the summit above the fertile valley, will be like a ripe fig before the summer harvest: Whoever sees it will take it in his hand and swallow it.
- **Isaiah 28:5**
On that day the LORD of Hosts will be a crown of glory, a diadem of splendor to the remnant of His people,
- **Isaiah 28:6**
a spirit of justice to him who sits in judgment, and a strength to those who repel the onslaught at the gate.
- **Isaiah 28:7**
These also stagger from wine and stumble from strong drink: Priests and prophets reel from strong drink and are befuddled by wine. They stumble because of strong drink, muddled in their visions and stumbling in their judgments.
- **Isaiah 28:8**
For all their tables are covered with vomit; there is not a place without filth.
- **Isaiah 28:9**
Whom is He trying to teach? To whom is He explaining His message? To infants just weaned from milk? To babies removed from the breast?
- **Isaiah 28:10**
For they hear: “Order on order, order on order, line on line, line on line; a little here, a little there.”
- **Isaiah 28:11**
Indeed, with mocking lips and foreign tongues, He will speak to this people
- **Isaiah 28:12**
to whom He has said: “This is the place of rest, let the weary rest; this is the place of repose.” But they would not listen.
- **Isaiah 28:13**
Then the word of the LORD to them will become: “Order on order, order on order, line on line, line on line; a little here, a little there,” so that they will go stumbling backward and will be injured, ensnared, and captured.
- **Isaiah 28:14**
Therefore hear the word of the LORD, O scoffers who rule this people in Jerusalem.
- **Isaiah 28:15**
For you said, “We have made a covenant with death; we have fashioned an agreement with Sheol. When the overwhelming scourge passes through it will not touch us, because we have made lies our refuge and falsehood our hiding place.”
- **Isaiah 28:16**
So this is what the Lord GOD says: “See, I lay a stone in Zion, a tested stone, a precious cornerstone, a sure foundation; the one who believes will never be shaken.
- **Isaiah 28:17**
I will make justice the measuring line and righteousness the level. Hail will sweep away your refuge of lies, and water will flood your hiding place.
- **Isaiah 28:18**
Your covenant with death will be dissolved, and your agreement with Sheol will not stand. When the overwhelming scourge passes through, you will be trampled by it.
- **Isaiah 28:19**
As often as it passes through, it will carry you away; it will sweep through morning after morning, by day and by night.” The understanding of this message will bring sheer terror.
- **Isaiah 28:20**
Indeed, the bed is too short to stretch out on, and the blanket too small to wrap around you.
- **Isaiah 28:21**
For the LORD will rise up as at Mount Perazim. He will rouse Himself as in the Valley of Gibeon, to do His work, His strange work, and to perform His task, His disturbing task.
- **Isaiah 28:22**
So now, do not mock, or your shackles will become heavier. Indeed, I have heard from the Lord GOD of Hosts a decree of destruction against the whole land.
- **Isaiah 28:23**
Listen and hear my voice. Pay attention and hear what I say.
- **Isaiah 28:24**
Does the plowman plow for planting every day? Does he continuously loosen and harrow the soil?
- **Isaiah 28:25**
When he has leveled its surface, does he not sow caraway and scatter cumin? He plants wheat in rows and barley in plots, and rye within its border.
- **Isaiah 28:26**
For his God instructs and teaches him properly.
- **Isaiah 28:27**
Surely caraway is not threshed with a sledge, and the wheel of a cart is not rolled over the cumin. But caraway is beaten out with a stick, and cumin with a rod.
- **Isaiah 28:28**
Grain for bread must be ground, but it is not endlessly threshed. Though the wheels of the cart roll over it, the horses do not crush it.
- **Isaiah 28:29**
This also comes from the LORD of Hosts, who is wonderful in counsel and excellent in wisdom.
- **Isaiah 29:1**
Woe to you, O Ariel, the city of Ariel where David camped! Year upon year let your festivals recur.
- **Isaiah 29:2**
And I will constrain Ariel, and there will be mourning and lamentation; she will be like an altar hearth before Me.
- **Isaiah 29:3**
I will camp in a circle around you; I will besiege you with towers and set up siege works against you.
- **Isaiah 29:4**
You will be brought low, you will speak from the ground, and out of the dust your words will be muffled. Your voice will be like a spirit from the ground; your speech will whisper out of the dust.
- **Isaiah 29:5**
But your many foes will be like fine dust, the multitude of the ruthless like blowing chaff. Then suddenly, in an instant,
- **Isaiah 29:6**
you will be visited by the LORD of Hosts with thunder and earthquake and loud noise, with windstorm and tempest and consuming flame of fire.
- **Isaiah 29:7**
All the many nations going out to battle against Ariel—even all who war against her, laying siege and attacking her—will be like a dream, like a vision in the night,
- **Isaiah 29:8**
as when a hungry man dreams he is eating, then awakens still hungry; as when a thirsty man dreams he is drinking, then awakens faint and parched. So will it be for all the many nations who go to battle against Mount Zion.
- **Isaiah 29:9**
Stop and be astonished; blind yourselves and be sightless; be drunk, but not with wine; stagger, but not from strong drink.
- **Isaiah 29:10**
For the LORD has poured out on you a spirit of deep sleep. He has shut your eyes, O prophets; He has covered your heads, O seers.
- **Isaiah 29:11**
And the entire vision will be to you like the words sealed in a scroll. If it is handed to someone to read, he will say, “I cannot, because it is sealed.”
- **Isaiah 29:12**
Or if the scroll is handed to one unable to read, he will say, “I cannot read.”
- **Isaiah 29:13**
Therefore the Lord said: “These people draw near to Me with their mouths and honor Me with their lips, but their hearts are far from Me. Their worship of Me is but rules taught by men.
- **Isaiah 29:14**
Therefore I will again confound these people with wonder upon wonder. The wisdom of the wise will vanish, and the intelligence of the intelligent will be hidden.”
- **Isaiah 29:15**
Woe to those who dig deep to hide their plans from the LORD. In darkness they do their works and say, “Who sees us, and who will know?”
- **Isaiah 29:16**
You have turned things upside down, as if the potter were regarded as clay. Shall what is formed say to him who formed it, “He did not make me”? Can the pottery say of the potter, “He has no understanding”?
- **Isaiah 29:17**
In a very short time, will not Lebanon become an orchard, and the orchard seem like a forest?
- **Isaiah 29:18**
On that day the deaf will hear the words of the scroll, and out of the deep darkness the eyes of the blind will see.
- **Isaiah 29:19**
The humble will increase their joy in the LORD, and the poor among men will rejoice in the Holy One of Israel.
- **Isaiah 29:20**
For the ruthless will vanish, the mockers will disappear, and all who look for evil will be cut down—
- **Isaiah 29:21**
those who indict a man with a word, who ensnare the mediator at the gate, and who with false charges deprive the innocent of justice.
- **Isaiah 29:22**
Therefore the LORD who redeemed Abraham says of the house of Jacob: “No longer will Jacob be ashamed and no more will his face grow pale.
- **Isaiah 29:23**
For when he sees his children around him, the work of My hands, they will honor My name, they will sanctify the Holy One of Jacob, and they will stand in awe of the God of Israel.
- **Isaiah 29:24**
Then the wayward in spirit will come to understanding, and those who grumble will accept instruction.”
- **Isaiah 30:1**
“Woe to the rebellious children,” declares the LORD, “to those who carry out a plan that is not Mine, who form an alliance, but against My will, heaping up sin upon sin.
- **Isaiah 30:2**
They set out to go down to Egypt without asking My advice, to seek shelter under Pharaoh’s protection and take refuge in Egypt’s shade.
- **Isaiah 30:3**
But Pharaoh’s protection will become your shame, and the refuge of Egypt’s shade your disgrace.
- **Isaiah 30:4**
For though their princes are at Zoan and their envoys have arrived in Hanes,
- **Isaiah 30:5**
everyone will be put to shame because of a people useless to them. They cannot be of help; they are good for nothing but shame and reproach.”
- **Isaiah 30:6**
This is the burden against the beasts of the Negev: Through a land of hardship and distress, of lioness and lion, of viper and flying serpent, they carry their wealth on the backs of donkeys and their treasures on the humps of camels, to a people of no profit to them.
- **Isaiah 30:7**
Egypt’s help is futile and empty; therefore I have called her Rahab Who Sits Still.
- **Isaiah 30:8**
Go now, write it on a tablet in their presence and inscribe it on a scroll; it will be for the days to come, a witness forever and ever.
- **Isaiah 30:9**
These are rebellious people, deceitful children, children unwilling to obey the LORD’s instruction.
- **Isaiah 30:10**
They say to the seers, “Stop seeing visions!” and to the prophets, “Do not prophesy to us the truth! Speak to us pleasant words; prophesy illusions.
- **Isaiah 30:11**
Get out of the way; turn off the road. Rid us of the Holy One of Israel!”
- **Isaiah 30:12**
Therefore this is what the Holy One of Israel says: “Because you have rejected this message, trusting in oppression and relying on deceit,
- **Isaiah 30:13**
this iniquity of yours is like a breach about to fail, a bulge in a high wall, whose collapse will come suddenly—in an instant!
- **Isaiah 30:14**
It will break in pieces like a potter’s jar, shattered so that no fragment can be found. Not a shard will be found in the dust large enough to scoop the coals from a hearth or to skim the water from a cistern.”
- **Isaiah 30:15**
For the Lord GOD, the Holy One of Israel, has said: “By repentance and rest you would be saved; your strength would lie in quiet confidence—but you were not willing.”
- **Isaiah 30:16**
“No,” you say, “we will flee on horses.” Therefore you will flee! “We will ride swift horses,” but your pursuers will be faster.
- **Isaiah 30:17**
A thousand will flee at the threat of one; at the threat of five you will all flee, until you are left alone like a pole on a mountaintop, like a banner on a hill.
- **Isaiah 30:18**
Therefore the LORD longs to be gracious to you; therefore He rises to show you compassion, for the LORD is a just God. Blessed are all who wait for Him.
- **Isaiah 30:19**
O people in Zion who dwell in Jerusalem, you will weep no more. He will surely be gracious when you cry for help; when He hears, He will answer you.
- **Isaiah 30:20**
The Lord will give you the bread of adversity and the water of affliction, but your Teacher will no longer hide Himself—with your own eyes you will see Him.
- **Isaiah 30:21**
And whether you turn to the right or to the left, your ears will hear this command behind you: “This is the way. Walk in it.”
- **Isaiah 30:22**
So you will desecrate your silver-plated idols and your gold-plated images. You will throw them away like menstrual cloths, saying to them, “Be gone!”
- **Isaiah 30:23**
Then He will send rain for the seed that you have sown in the ground, and the food that comes from your land will be rich and plentiful. On that day your cattle will graze in open pastures.
- **Isaiah 30:24**
The oxen and donkeys that work the ground will eat salted fodder, winnowed with shovel and pitchfork.
- **Isaiah 30:25**
And from every high mountain and every raised hill, streams of water will flow in the day of great slaughter, when the towers fall.
- **Isaiah 30:26**
The light of the moon will be as bright as the sun, and the light of the sun will be seven times brighter—like the light of seven days—on the day that the LORD binds up the brokenness of His people and heals the wounds He has inflicted.
- **Isaiah 30:27**
Behold, the Name of the LORD comes from afar, with burning anger and dense smoke. His lips are full of fury, and His tongue is like a consuming fire.
- **Isaiah 30:28**
His breath is like a rushing torrent that rises to the neck. He comes to sift the nations in a sieve of destruction; He bridles the jaws of the peoples to lead them astray.
- **Isaiah 30:29**
You will sing as on the night of a holy festival, and your heart will rejoice like one who walks to the music of a flute, going up to the mountain of the LORD, to the Rock of Israel.
- **Isaiah 30:30**
And the LORD will cause His majestic voice to be heard and His mighty arm to be revealed, striking in angry wrath with a flame of consuming fire, and with cloudburst, storm, and hailstones.
- **Isaiah 30:31**
For Assyria will be shattered at the voice of the LORD; He will strike them with His scepter.
- **Isaiah 30:32**
And with every stroke of the rod of punishment that the LORD brings down on them, the tambourines and lyres will sound as He battles with weapons brandished.
- **Isaiah 30:33**
For Topheth has long been prepared; it has been made ready for the king. Its funeral pyre is deep and wide, with plenty of fire and wood. The breath of the LORD, like a torrent of burning sulfur, sets it ablaze.
- **Isaiah 31:1**
Woe to those who go down to Egypt for help, who rely on horses, who trust in their abundance of chariots and in their multitude of horsemen. They do not look to the Holy One of Israel; they do not seek the LORD.
- **Isaiah 31:2**
Yet He too is wise and brings disaster; He does not call back His words. He will rise up against the house of the wicked and against the allies of evildoers.
- **Isaiah 31:3**
But the Egyptians are men, not God; their horses are flesh, not spirit. When the LORD stretches out His hand, the helper will stumble, and the one he helps will fall; both will perish together.
- **Isaiah 31:4**
For this is what the LORD has said to me: “Like a lion roaring or a young lion over its prey—and though a band of shepherds is called out against it, it is not terrified by their shouting or subdued by their clamor—so the LORD of Hosts will come down to do battle on Mount Zion and its heights.
- **Isaiah 31:5**
Like birds hovering overhead, so the LORD of Hosts will protect Jerusalem. He will shield it and deliver it; He will pass over it and preserve it.”
- **Isaiah 31:6**
Return to the One against whom you have so blatantly rebelled, O children of Israel.
- **Isaiah 31:7**
For on that day, every one of you will reject the idols of silver and gold that your own hands have sinfully made.
- **Isaiah 31:8**
“Then Assyria will fall, but not by the sword of man; a sword will devour them, but not one made by mortals. They will flee before the sword, and their young men will be put to forced labor.
- **Isaiah 31:9**
Their rock will pass away for fear, and their princes will panic at the sight of the battle standard,” declares the LORD, whose fire is in Zion, whose furnace is in Jerusalem.
- **Isaiah 32:1**
Behold, a king will reign in righteousness, and princes will rule with justice.
- **Isaiah 32:2**
Each will be like a shelter from the wind, a refuge from the storm, like streams of water in a dry land, like the shadow of a great rock in an arid land.
- **Isaiah 32:3**
Then the eyes of those who see will no longer be closed, and the ears of those who hear will listen.
- **Isaiah 32:4**
The mind of the rash will know and understand, and the stammering tongue will speak clearly and fluently.
- **Isaiah 32:5**
No longer will a fool be called noble, nor a scoundrel be respected.
- **Isaiah 32:6**
For a fool speaks foolishness; his mind plots iniquity. He practices ungodliness and speaks falsely about the LORD; he leaves the hungry empty and deprives the thirsty of drink.
- **Isaiah 32:7**
The weapons of the scoundrel are destructive; he hatches plots to destroy the poor with lies, even when the plea of the needy is just.
- **Isaiah 32:8**
But a noble man makes honorable plans; he stands up for worthy causes.
- **Isaiah 32:9**
Stand up, you complacent women; listen to me. Give ear to my word, you overconfident daughters.
- **Isaiah 32:10**
In a little more than a year you will tremble, O secure ones. For the grape harvest will fail and the fruit harvest will not arrive.
- **Isaiah 32:11**
Shudder, you ladies of leisure; tremble, you daughters of complacency. Strip yourselves bare and put sackcloth around your waists.
- **Isaiah 32:12**
Beat your breasts for the pleasant fields, for the fruitful vines,
- **Isaiah 32:13**
and for the land of my people, overgrown with thorns and briers—even for every house of merriment in this city of revelry.
- **Isaiah 32:14**
For the palace will be forsaken, the busy city abandoned. The hill and the watchtower will become caves forever—the delight of wild donkeys and a pasture for flocks—
- **Isaiah 32:15**
until the Spirit is poured out upon us from on high. Then the desert will be an orchard, and the orchard will seem like a forest.
- **Isaiah 32:16**
Then justice will inhabit the wilderness, and righteousness will dwell in the fertile field.
- **Isaiah 32:17**
The work of righteousness will be peace; the service of righteousness will be quiet confidence forever.
- **Isaiah 32:18**
Then my people will dwell in a peaceful place, in safe and secure places of rest.
- **Isaiah 32:19**
But hail will level the forest, and the city will sink to the depths.
- **Isaiah 32:20**
Blessed are those who sow beside abundant waters, who let the ox and donkey range freely.
- **Isaiah 33:1**
Woe to you, O destroyer never destroyed, O traitor never betrayed! When you have finished destroying, you will be destroyed. When you have finished betraying, you will be betrayed.
- **Isaiah 33:2**
O LORD, be gracious to us! We wait for You. Be our strength every morning and our salvation in time of trouble.
- **Isaiah 33:3**
The peoples flee the thunder of Your voice; the nations scatter when You rise.
- **Isaiah 33:4**
Your spoil, O nations, is gathered as by locusts; like a swarm of locusts men sweep over it.
- **Isaiah 33:5**
The LORD is exalted, for He dwells on high; He has filled Zion with justice and righteousness.
- **Isaiah 33:6**
He will be the sure foundation for your times, a storehouse of salvation, wisdom, and knowledge. The fear of the LORD is Zion’s treasure.
- **Isaiah 33:7**
Behold, their valiant ones cry aloud in the streets; the envoys of peace weep bitterly.
- **Isaiah 33:8**
The highways are deserted; travel has ceased. The treaty has been broken, the witnesses are despised, and human life is disregarded.
- **Isaiah 33:9**
The land mourns and languishes; Lebanon is ashamed and decayed. Sharon is like a desert; Bashan and Carmel shake off their leaves.
- **Isaiah 33:10**
“Now I will arise,” says the LORD. “Now I will lift Myself up. Now I will be exalted.
- **Isaiah 33:11**
You conceive chaff; you give birth to stubble. Your breath is a fire that will consume you.
- **Isaiah 33:12**
The peoples will be burned to ashes, like thorns cut down and set ablaze.
- **Isaiah 33:13**
You who are far off, hear what I have done; you who are near, acknowledge My might.”
- **Isaiah 33:14**
The sinners in Zion are afraid; trembling grips the ungodly: “Who of us can dwell with a consuming fire? Who of us can dwell with everlasting flames?”
- **Isaiah 33:15**
He who walks righteously and speaks with sincerity, who refuses gain from extortion, whose hand never takes a bribe, who stops his ears against murderous plots and shuts his eyes tightly against evil—
- **Isaiah 33:16**
he will dwell on the heights; the mountain fortress will be his refuge; his food will be provided and his water assured.
- **Isaiah 33:17**
Your eyes will see the King in His beauty and behold a land that stretches afar.
- **Isaiah 33:18**
Your mind will ponder the former terror: “Where is he who tallies? Where is he who weighs? Where is he who counts the towers?”
- **Isaiah 33:19**
You will no longer see the insolent, a people whose speech is unintelligible, who stammer in a language you cannot understand.
- **Isaiah 33:20**
Look upon Zion, the city of our appointed feasts. Your eyes will see Jerusalem, a peaceful pasture, a tent that does not wander; its tent pegs will not be pulled up, nor will any of its cords be broken.
- **Isaiah 33:21**
But there the Majestic One, our LORD, will be for us a place of rivers and wide canals, where no galley with oars will row, and no majestic vessel will pass.
- **Isaiah 33:22**
For the LORD is our Judge, the LORD is our lawgiver, the LORD is our King. It is He who will save us.
- **Isaiah 33:23**
Your ropes are slack; they cannot secure the mast or spread the sail. Then an abundance of spoils will be divided, and even the lame will carry off plunder.
- **Isaiah 33:24**
And no resident of Zion will say, “I am sick.” The people who dwell there will be forgiven of iniquity.
- **Isaiah 34:1**
Come near, O nations, to listen; pay attention, O peoples. Let the earth hear, and all that fills it, the world and all that springs from it.
- **Isaiah 34:2**
The LORD is angry with all the nations and furious with all their armies. He will devote them to destruction; He will give them over to slaughter.
- **Isaiah 34:3**
Their slain will be left unburied, and the stench of their corpses will rise; the mountains will flow with their blood.
- **Isaiah 34:4**
All the stars of heaven will be dissolved. The skies will be rolled up like a scroll, and all their stars will fall like withered leaves from the vine, like foliage from the fig tree.
- **Isaiah 34:5**
When My sword has drunk its fill in the heavens, then it will come down upon Edom, upon the people I have devoted to destruction.
- **Isaiah 34:6**
The sword of the LORD is bathed in blood. It drips with fat—with the blood of lambs and goats, with the fat of the kidneys of rams. For the LORD has a sacrifice in Bozrah, a great slaughter in the land of Edom.
- **Isaiah 34:7**
And the wild oxen will fall with them, the young bulls with the strong ones. Their land will be drenched with blood, and their soil will be soaked with fat.
- **Isaiah 34:8**
For the LORD has a day of vengeance, a year of recompense for the cause of Zion.
- **Isaiah 34:9**
Edom’s streams will be turned to tar, and her soil to sulfur; her land will become a blazing pitch.
- **Isaiah 34:10**
It will not be quenched—day or night. Its smoke will ascend forever. From generation to generation it will lie desolate; no one will ever again pass through it.
- **Isaiah 34:11**
The desert owl and screech owl will possess it, and the great owl and raven will dwell in it. The LORD will stretch out over Edom a measuring line of chaos and a plumb line of destruction.
- **Isaiah 34:12**
No nobles will be left to proclaim a king, and all her princes will come to nothing.
- **Isaiah 34:13**
Her towers will be overgrown with thorns, her fortresses with thistles and briers. She will become a haunt for jackals, an abode for ostriches.
- **Isaiah 34:14**
The desert creatures will meet with hyenas, and one wild goat will call to another. There the night creature will settle and find her place of repose.
- **Isaiah 34:15**
There the owl will make her nest; she will lay and hatch her eggs and gather her brood under her shadow. Even there the birds of prey will gather, each with its mate.
- **Isaiah 34:16**
Search and read the scroll of the LORD: Not one of these will go missing, not one will lack her mate, because He has ordered it by His mouth, and He will gather them by His Spirit.
- **Isaiah 34:17**
He has allotted their portion; His hand has distributed it by measure. They will possess it forever; they will dwell in it from generation to generation.
- **Isaiah 35:1**
The wilderness and the land will be glad; the desert will rejoice and blossom like a rose.
- **Isaiah 35:2**
It will bloom profusely and rejoice with joy and singing. The glory of Lebanon will be given to it, the splendor of Carmel and Sharon. They will see the glory of the LORD, the splendor of our God.
- **Isaiah 35:3**
Strengthen the limp hands and steady the feeble knees!
- **Isaiah 35:4**
Say to those with anxious hearts: “Be strong, do not fear! Behold, your God will come with vengeance. With divine retribution He will come to save you.”
- **Isaiah 35:5**
Then the eyes of the blind will be opened and the ears of the deaf unstopped.
- **Isaiah 35:6**
Then the lame will leap like a deer and the mute tongue will shout for joy. For waters will gush forth in the wilderness, and streams in the desert.
- **Isaiah 35:7**
The parched ground will become a pool, the thirsty land springs of water. In the haunt where jackals once lay, there will be grass and reeds and papyrus.
- **Isaiah 35:8**
And there will be a highway called the Way of Holiness. The unclean will not travel it—only those who walk in the Way—and fools will not stray onto it.
- **Isaiah 35:9**
No lion will be there, and no vicious beast will go up on it. Such will not be found there, but the redeemed will walk upon it.
- **Isaiah 35:10**
So the redeemed of the LORD will return and enter Zion with singing, crowned with everlasting joy. Gladness and joy will overtake them, and sorrow and sighing will flee.
- **Isaiah 36:1**
In the fourteenth year of Hezekiah’s reign, Sennacherib king of Assyria attacked and captured all the fortified cities of Judah.
- **Isaiah 36:2**
And the king of Assyria sent the Rabshakeh, with a great army, from Lachish to King Hezekiah at Jerusalem. And he stopped by the aqueduct of the upper pool, on the road to the Launderer’s Field.
- **Isaiah 36:3**
Then Eliakim son of Hilkiah the palace administrator, Shebna the scribe, and Joah son of Asaph the recorder, went out to him.
- **Isaiah 36:4**
The Rabshakeh said to them, “Tell Hezekiah that this is what the great king, the king of Assyria, says: What is the basis of this confidence of yours?
- **Isaiah 36:5**
You claim to have a strategy and strength for war, but these are empty words. In whom are you now trusting, that you have rebelled against me?
- **Isaiah 36:6**
Look now, you are trusting in Egypt, that splintered reed of a staff that will pierce the hand of anyone who leans on it. Such is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all who trust in him.
- **Isaiah 36:7**
But if you say to me, ‘We trust in the LORD our God,’ is He not the One whose high places and altars Hezekiah has removed, saying to Judah and Jerusalem, ‘You must worship before this altar’?
- **Isaiah 36:8**
Now, therefore, make a bargain with my master, the king of Assyria. I will give you two thousand horses—if you can put riders on them!
- **Isaiah 36:9**
For how can you repel a single officer among the least of my master’s servants when you depend on Egypt for chariots and horsemen?
- **Isaiah 36:10**
So now, was it apart from the LORD that I have come up against this land to destroy it? The LORD Himself said to me, ‘Go up against this land and destroy it.’”
- **Isaiah 36:11**
Then Eliakim, Shebna, and Joah said to the Rabshakeh, “Please speak to your servants in Aramaic, since we understand it. Do not speak to us in Hebrew in the hearing of the people on the wall.”
- **Isaiah 36:12**
But the Rabshakeh replied, “Has my master sent me to speak these words only to you and your master, and not to the men sitting on the wall, who are destined with you to eat their own dung and drink their own urine?”
- **Isaiah 36:13**
Then the Rabshakeh stood and called out loudly in Hebrew: “Hear the words of the great king, the king of Assyria!
- **Isaiah 36:14**
This is what the king says: Do not let Hezekiah deceive you, for he cannot deliver you.
- **Isaiah 36:15**
Do not let Hezekiah persuade you to trust in the LORD when he says, ‘The LORD will surely deliver us; this city will not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.’
- **Isaiah 36:16**
Do not listen to Hezekiah, for this is what the king of Assyria says: Make peace with me and come out to me. Then every one of you will eat from his own vine and his own fig tree, and drink water from his own cistern,
- **Isaiah 36:17**
until I come and take you away to a land like your own—a land of grain and new wine, a land of bread and vineyards.
- **Isaiah 36:18**
Do not let Hezekiah mislead you when he says, ‘The LORD will deliver us.’ Has the god of any nation ever delivered his land from the hand of the king of Assyria?
- **Isaiah 36:19**
Where are the gods of Hamath and Arpad? Where are the gods of Sepharvaim? Have they delivered Samaria from my hand?
- **Isaiah 36:20**
Who among all the gods of these lands has delivered his land from my hand? How then can the LORD deliver Jerusalem from my hand?”
- **Isaiah 36:21**
But the people remained silent and did not answer a word, for Hezekiah had commanded, “Do not answer him.”
- **Isaiah 36:22**
Then Hilkiah’s son Eliakim the palace administrator, Shebna the scribe, and Asaph’s son Joah the recorder came to Hezekiah with their clothes torn, and they relayed to him the words of the Rabshakeh.
- **Isaiah 37:1**
On hearing this report, King Hezekiah tore his clothes, put on sackcloth, and entered the house of the LORD.
- **Isaiah 37:2**
And he sent Eliakim the palace administrator, Shebna the scribe, and the leading priests, all wearing sackcloth, to the prophet Isaiah son of Amoz
- **Isaiah 37:3**
to tell him, “This is what Hezekiah says: Today is a day of distress, rebuke, and disgrace; for children have come to the point of birth, but there is no strength to deliver them.
- **Isaiah 37:4**
Perhaps the LORD your God will hear the words of the Rabshakeh, whom his master the king of Assyria has sent to defy the living God, and He will rebuke him for the words that the LORD your God has heard. Therefore lift up a prayer for the remnant that still survives.”
- **Isaiah 37:5**
So the servants of King Hezekiah went to Isaiah,
- **Isaiah 37:6**
who replied, “Tell your master that this is what the LORD says: ‘Do not be afraid of the words you have heard, with which the servants of the king of Assyria have blasphemed Me.
- **Isaiah 37:7**
Behold, I will put a spirit in him so that he will hear a rumor and return to his own land, where I will cause him to fall by the sword.’”
- **Isaiah 37:8**
When the Rabshakeh heard that the king of Assyria had left Lachish, he withdrew and found the king fighting against Libnah.
- **Isaiah 37:9**
Now Sennacherib had been warned about Tirhakah king of Cush: “He has set out to fight against you.” On hearing this, Sennacherib sent messengers to Hezekiah, saying,
- **Isaiah 37:10**
“Give this message to Hezekiah king of Judah: ‘Do not let your God, in whom you trust, deceive you by saying that Jerusalem will not be delivered into the hand of the king of Assyria.
- **Isaiah 37:11**
Surely you have heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all the other countries, devoting them to destruction. Will you then be spared?
- **Isaiah 37:12**
Did the gods of the nations destroyed by my fathers rescue those nations—the gods of Gozan, Haran, and Rezeph, and of the people of Eden in Telassar?
- **Isaiah 37:13**
Where are the kings of Hamath, Arpad, Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivvah?’”
- **Isaiah 37:14**
So Hezekiah received the letter from the messengers, read it, and went up to the house of the LORD and spread it out before the LORD.
- **Isaiah 37:15**
And Hezekiah prayed to the LORD:
- **Isaiah 37:16**
“O LORD of Hosts, God of Israel, enthroned above the cherubim, You alone are God over all the kingdoms of the earth. You made the heavens and the earth.
- **Isaiah 37:17**
Incline Your ear, O LORD, and hear; open Your eyes, O LORD, and see. Listen to all the words that Sennacherib has sent to defy the living God.
- **Isaiah 37:18**
Truly, O LORD, the kings of Assyria have laid waste all these countries and their lands.
- **Isaiah 37:19**
They have cast their gods into the fire and destroyed them, for they were not gods, but only wood and stone—the work of human hands.
- **Isaiah 37:20**
And now, O LORD our God, save us from his hand, so that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that You alone, O LORD, are God.”
- **Isaiah 37:21**
Then Isaiah son of Amoz sent a message to Hezekiah: “This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: Because you have prayed to Me concerning Sennacherib king of Assyria,
- **Isaiah 37:22**
this is the word that the LORD has spoken against him: ‘The Virgin Daughter of Zion despises you and mocks you; the Daughter of Jerusalem shakes her head behind you.
- **Isaiah 37:23**
Whom have you taunted and blasphemed? Against whom have you raised your voice and lifted your eyes in pride? Against the Holy One of Israel!
- **Isaiah 37:24**
Through your servants you have taunted the Lord, and you have said: “With my many chariots I have ascended to the heights of the mountains, to the remote peaks of Lebanon. I have cut down its tallest cedars, the finest of its cypresses. I have reached its farthest heights, the densest of its forests.
- **Isaiah 37:25**
I have dug wells and drunk foreign waters. With the soles of my feet I have dried up all the streams of Egypt.”
- **Isaiah 37:26**
Have you not heard? Long ago I ordained it; in days of old I planned it. Now I have brought it to pass, that you should crush fortified cities into piles of rubble.
- **Isaiah 37:27**
Therefore their inhabitants, devoid of power, are dismayed and ashamed. They are like plants in the field, tender green shoots, grass on the rooftops, scorched before it is grown.
- **Isaiah 37:28**
But I know your sitting down, your going out and coming in, and your raging against Me.
- **Isaiah 37:29**
Because your rage and arrogance against Me have reached My ears, I will put My hook in your nose and My bit in your mouth; I will send you back the way you came.’
- **Isaiah 37:30**
And this will be a sign to you, O Hezekiah: This year you will eat what grows on its own, and in the second year what springs from the same. But in the third year you will sow and reap; you will plant vineyards and eat their fruit.
- **Isaiah 37:31**
And the surviving remnant of the house of Judah will again take root below and bear fruit above.
- **Isaiah 37:32**
For a remnant will go forth from Jerusalem, and survivors from Mount Zion. The zeal of the LORD of Hosts will accomplish this.
- **Isaiah 37:33**
So this is what the LORD says about the king of Assyria: ‘He will not enter this city or shoot an arrow into it. He will not come before it with a shield or build up a siege ramp against it.
- **Isaiah 37:34**
He will go back the way he came, and he will not enter this city,’ declares the LORD.
- **Isaiah 37:35**
‘I will defend this city and save it for My own sake and for the sake of My servant David.’”
- **Isaiah 37:36**
Then the angel of the LORD went out and struck down 185,000 men in the camp of the Assyrians. When the people got up the next morning, there were all the dead bodies!
- **Isaiah 37:37**
So Sennacherib king of Assyria broke camp and withdrew. He returned to Nineveh and stayed there.
- **Isaiah 37:38**
One day, while he was worshiping in the temple of his god Nisroch, his sons Adrammelech and Sharezer put him to the sword and escaped to the land of Ararat. And his son Esar-haddon reigned in his place.
- **Isaiah 38:1**
In those days Hezekiah became mortally ill. The prophet Isaiah son of Amoz came to him and said, “This is what the LORD says: ‘Put your house in order, for you are about to die; you will not recover.’”
- **Isaiah 38:2**
Then Hezekiah turned his face to the wall and prayed to the LORD,
- **Isaiah 38:3**
saying, “Please, O LORD, remember how I have walked before You faithfully and with wholehearted devotion; I have done what was good in Your sight.” And Hezekiah wept bitterly.
- **Isaiah 38:4**
And the word of the LORD came to Isaiah, saying,
- **Isaiah 38:5**
“Go and tell Hezekiah that this is what the LORD, the God of your father David, says: ‘I have heard your prayer; I have seen your tears. Behold, I will add fifteen years to your life.
- **Isaiah 38:6**
And I will deliver you and this city from the hand of the king of Assyria. I will defend this city.
- **Isaiah 38:7**
This will be a sign to you from the LORD that He will do what He has promised:
- **Isaiah 38:8**
I will make the sun’s shadow that falls on the stairway of Ahaz go back ten steps.’” So the sunlight went back the ten steps it had descended.
- **Isaiah 38:9**
This is a writing by Hezekiah king of Judah after his illness and recovery:
- **Isaiah 38:10**
I said, “In the prime of my life I must go through the gates of Sheol and be deprived of the remainder of my years.”
- **Isaiah 38:11**
I said, “I will never again see the LORD, even the LORD, in the land of the living; I will no longer look on mankind with those who dwell in this world.
- **Isaiah 38:12**
My dwelling has been picked up and removed from me like a shepherd’s tent. I have rolled up my life like a weaver; He cuts me off from the loom; from day until night You make an end of me.
- **Isaiah 38:13**
I composed myself until the morning. Like a lion He breaks all my bones; from day until night You make an end of me.
- **Isaiah 38:14**
I chirp like a swallow or crane; I moan like a dove. My eyes grow weak as I look upward. O Lord, I am oppressed; be my security.”
- **Isaiah 38:15**
What can I say? He has spoken to me, and He Himself has done this. I will walk slowly all my years because of the anguish of my soul.
- **Isaiah 38:16**
O Lord, by such things men live, and in all of them my spirit finds life. You have restored me to health and have let me live.
- **Isaiah 38:17**
Surely for my own welfare I had such great anguish; but Your love has delivered me from the pit of oblivion, for You have cast all my sins behind Your back.
- **Isaiah 38:18**
For Sheol cannot thank You; Death cannot praise You. Those who descend to the Pit cannot hope for Your faithfulness.
- **Isaiah 38:19**
The living, only the living, can thank You, as I do today; fathers will tell their children about Your faithfulness.
- **Isaiah 38:20**
The LORD will save me; we will play songs on stringed instruments all the days of our lives in the house of the LORD.
- **Isaiah 38:21**
Now Isaiah had said, “Prepare a lump of pressed figs and apply it to the boil, and he will recover.”
- **Isaiah 38:22**
And Hezekiah had asked, “What will be the sign that I will go up to the house of the LORD?”
- **Isaiah 39:1**
At that time Merodach-baladan son of Baladan king of Babylon sent letters and a gift to Hezekiah, for he had heard about Hezekiah’s illness and recovery.
- **Isaiah 39:2**
And Hezekiah welcomed the envoys gladly and showed them what was in his treasure house—the silver, the gold, the spices, and the precious oil, as well as his entire armory—all that was found in his storehouses. There was nothing in his palace or in all his dominion that Hezekiah did not show them.
- **Isaiah 39:3**
Then the prophet Isaiah went to King Hezekiah and asked, “Where did those men come from, and what did they say to you?” “They came to me from a distant land,” Hezekiah replied, “from Babylon.”
- **Isaiah 39:4**
“What have they seen in your palace?” Isaiah asked. “They have seen everything in my palace,” answered Hezekiah. “There is nothing among my treasures that I did not show them.”
- **Isaiah 39:5**
Then Isaiah said to Hezekiah, “Hear the word of the LORD of Hosts:
- **Isaiah 39:6**
The time will surely come when everything in your palace and all that your fathers have stored up until this day will be carried off to Babylon. Nothing will be left, says the LORD.
- **Isaiah 39:7**
And some of your descendants, your own flesh and blood, will be taken away to be eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon.”
- **Isaiah 39:8**
But Hezekiah said to Isaiah, “The word of the LORD that you have spoken is good.” For he thought, “At least there will be peace and security in my lifetime.”
- **Isaiah 40:1**
“Comfort, comfort My people,” says your God.
- **Isaiah 40:2**
“Speak tenderly to Jerusalem, and proclaim to her that her forced labor has been completed; her iniquity has been pardoned. For she has received from the hand of the LORD double for all her sins.”
- **Isaiah 40:3**
A voice of one calling: “Prepare the way for the LORD in the wilderness; make a straight highway for our God in the desert.
- **Isaiah 40:4**
Every valley shall be lifted up, and every mountain and hill made low; the uneven ground will become smooth, and the rugged land a plain.
- **Isaiah 40:5**
And the glory of the LORD will be revealed, and all humanity together will see it. For the mouth of the LORD has spoken.”
- **Isaiah 40:6**
A voice says, “Cry out!” And I asked, “What should I cry out?” “All flesh is like grass, and all its glory like the flowers of the field.
- **Isaiah 40:7**
The grass withers and the flowers fall when the breath of the LORD blows on them; indeed, the people are grass.
- **Isaiah 40:8**
The grass withers and the flowers fall, but the word of our God stands forever.”
- **Isaiah 40:9**
Go up on a high mountain, O Zion, herald of good news. Raise your voice loudly, O Jerusalem, herald of good news. Lift it up, do not be afraid! Say to the cities of Judah, “Here is your God!”
- **Isaiah 40:10**
Behold, the Lord GOD comes with might, and His arm establishes His rule. His reward is with Him, and His recompense accompanies Him.
- **Isaiah 40:11**
He tends His flock like a shepherd; He gathers the lambs in His arms and carries them close to His heart. He gently leads the nursing ewes.
- **Isaiah 40:12**
Who has measured the waters in the hollow of his hand, or marked off the heavens with the span of his hand? Who has held the dust of the earth in a basket, or weighed the mountains on a scale and the hills with a balance?
- **Isaiah 40:13**
Who has directed the Spirit of the LORD, or informed Him as His counselor?
- **Isaiah 40:14**
Whom did He consult to enlighten Him, and who taught Him the paths of justice? Who imparted knowledge to Him and showed Him the way of understanding?
- **Isaiah 40:15**
Surely the nations are like a drop in a bucket; they are considered a speck of dust on the scales; He lifts up the islands like fine dust.
- **Isaiah 40:16**
Lebanon is not sufficient for fuel, nor its animals enough for a burnt offering.
- **Isaiah 40:17**
All the nations are as nothing before Him; He regards them as nothingness and emptiness.
- **Isaiah 40:18**
To whom will you liken God? To what image will you compare Him?
- **Isaiah 40:19**
To an idol that a craftsman casts and a metalworker overlays with gold and fits with silver chains?
- **Isaiah 40:20**
To one bereft of an offering who chooses wood that will not rot, who seeks a skilled craftsman to set up an idol that will not topple?
- **Isaiah 40:21**
Do you not know? Have you not heard? Has it not been declared to you from the beginning? Have you not understood since the foundation of the earth?
- **Isaiah 40:22**
He sits enthroned above the circle of the earth; its dwellers are like grasshoppers. He stretches out the heavens like a curtain, and spreads them out like a tent to dwell in.
- **Isaiah 40:23**
He brings the princes to nothing and makes the rulers of the earth meaningless.
- **Isaiah 40:24**
No sooner are they planted, no sooner are they sown, no sooner have their stems taken root in the ground, than He blows on them and they wither, and a whirlwind sweeps them away like stubble.
- **Isaiah 40:25**
“To whom will you liken Me, or who is My equal?” asks the Holy One.
- **Isaiah 40:26**
Lift up your eyes on high: Who created all these? He leads forth the starry host by number; He calls each one by name. Because of His great power and mighty strength, not one of them is missing.
- **Isaiah 40:27**
Why do you say, O Jacob, and why do you assert, O Israel, “My way is hidden from the LORD, and my claim is ignored by my God”?
- **Isaiah 40:28**
Do you not know? Have you not heard? The LORD is the everlasting God, the Creator of the ends of the earth. He will not grow tired or weary; His understanding is beyond searching out.
- **Isaiah 40:29**
He gives power to the faint and increases the strength of the weak.
- **Isaiah 40:30**
Even youths grow tired and weary, and young men stumble and fall.
- **Isaiah 40:31**
But those who wait upon the LORD will renew their strength; they will mount up with wings like eagles; they will run and not grow weary, they will walk and not faint.
- **Isaiah 41:1**
“Be silent before Me, O islands, and let the peoples renew their strength. Let them come forward and testify; let us together draw near for judgment.
- **Isaiah 41:2**
Who has aroused one from the east and called him to his feet in righteousness? He hands nations over to him and subdues kings before him. He turns them to dust with his sword, to windblown chaff with his bow.
- **Isaiah 41:3**
He pursues them, going on safely, hardly touching the path with his feet.
- **Isaiah 41:4**
Who has performed this and carried it out, calling forth the generations from the beginning? I, the LORD—the first and the last—I am He.”
- **Isaiah 41:5**
The islands see and fear; the ends of the earth tremble. They approach and come forward.
- **Isaiah 41:6**
Each one helps the other and says to his brother, “Be strong!”
- **Isaiah 41:7**
The craftsman encourages the goldsmith, and he who wields the hammer cheers him who strikes the anvil, saying of the welding, “It is good.” He nails it down so it will not be toppled.
- **Isaiah 41:8**
“But you, O Israel, My servant, Jacob, whom I have chosen, descendant of Abraham My friend—
- **Isaiah 41:9**
I brought you from the ends of the earth and called you from its farthest corners. I said, ‘You are My servant.’ I have chosen and not rejected you.
- **Isaiah 41:10**
Do not fear, for I am with you; do not be afraid, for I am your God. I will strengthen you; I will surely help you; I will uphold you with My right hand of righteousness.
- **Isaiah 41:11**
Behold, all who rage against you will be ashamed and disgraced; those who contend with you will be reduced to nothing and will perish.
- **Isaiah 41:12**
You will seek them but will not find them. Those who wage war against you will come to nothing.
- **Isaiah 41:13**
For I am the LORD your God, who takes hold of your right hand and tells you: Do not fear, I will help you.
- **Isaiah 41:14**
Do not fear, O worm of Jacob, O few men of Israel. I will help you,” declares the LORD. “Your Redeemer is the Holy One of Israel.
- **Isaiah 41:15**
Behold, I will make you into a threshing sledge, new and sharp, with many teeth. You will thresh the mountains and crush them, and reduce the hills to chaff.
- **Isaiah 41:16**
You will winnow them, and a wind will carry them away; a gale will scatter them. But you will rejoice in the LORD; you will glory in the Holy One of Israel.
- **Isaiah 41:17**
The poor and needy seek water, but there is none; their tongues are parched with thirst. I, the LORD, will answer them; I, the God of Israel, will not forsake them.
- **Isaiah 41:18**
I will open rivers on the barren heights, and fountains in the middle of the valleys. I will turn the desert into a pool of water, and the dry land into flowing springs.
- **Isaiah 41:19**
I will plant cedars in the wilderness, acacias, myrtles, and olive trees. I will set cypresses in the desert, elms and boxwood together,
- **Isaiah 41:20**
so that all may see and know, may consider and understand, that the hand of the LORD has done this and the Holy One of Israel has created it.”
- **Isaiah 41:21**
“Present your case,” says the LORD. “Submit your arguments,” says the King of Jacob.
- **Isaiah 41:22**
“Let them come and tell us what will happen. Tell the former things, so that we may reflect on them and know the outcome. Or announce to us what is coming.
- **Isaiah 41:23**
Tell us the things that are to come, so that we may know that you are gods. Yes, do something good or evil, that we may look on together in dismay.
- **Isaiah 41:24**
Behold, you are nothing and your work is of no value. Anyone who chooses you is detestable.
- **Isaiah 41:25**
I have raised up one from the north, and he has come—one from the east who calls on My name. He will march over rulers as if they were mortar, like a potter who treads the clay.
- **Isaiah 41:26**
Who has declared this from the beginning, so that we may know, and from times past, so that we may say: ‘He was right’? No one announced it, no one foretold it, no one heard your words.
- **Isaiah 41:27**
I was the first to tell Zion: ‘Look, here they are!’ And I gave to Jerusalem a herald of good news.
- **Isaiah 41:28**
When I look, there is no one; there is no counselor among them; when I ask them, they have nothing to say.
- **Isaiah 41:29**
See, they are all a delusion; their works amount to nothing; their images are as empty as the wind.
- **Isaiah 42:1**
“Here is My Servant, whom I uphold, My Chosen One, in whom My soul delights. I will put My Spirit on Him, and He will bring justice to the nations.
- **Isaiah 42:2**
He will not cry out or raise His voice, nor make His voice heard in the streets.
- **Isaiah 42:3**
A bruised reed He will not break and a smoldering wick He will not extinguish; He will faithfully bring forth justice.
- **Isaiah 42:4**
He will not grow weak or discouraged before He has established justice on the earth. In His law the islands will put their hope.”
- **Isaiah 42:5**
This is what God the LORD says—He who created the heavens and stretched them out, who spread out the earth and its offspring, who gives breath to the people on it and life to those who walk in it:
- **Isaiah 42:6**
“I, the LORD, have called you for a righteous purpose, and I will take hold of your hand. I will keep you and appoint you to be a covenant for the people and a light to the nations,
- **Isaiah 42:7**
to open the eyes of the blind, to bring prisoners out of the dungeon and those sitting in darkness out from the prison house.
- **Isaiah 42:8**
I am the LORD; that is My name! I will not yield My glory to another or My praise to idols.
- **Isaiah 42:9**
Behold, the former things have happened, and now I declare new things. Before they spring forth I proclaim them to you.”
- **Isaiah 42:10**
Sing to the LORD a new song—His praise from the ends of the earth—you who go down to the sea, and all that is in it, you islands, and all who dwell in them.
- **Isaiah 42:11**
Let the desert and its cities raise their voices; let the villages of Kedar cry aloud. Let the people of Sela sing for joy; let them cry out from the mountaintops.
- **Isaiah 42:12**
Let them give glory to the LORD and declare His praise in the islands.
- **Isaiah 42:13**
The LORD goes forth like a mighty one; He stirs up His zeal like a warrior. He shouts; yes, He roars in triumph over His enemies:
- **Isaiah 42:14**
“I have kept silent from ages past; I have remained quiet and restrained. But now I will groan like a woman in labor; I will at once gasp and pant.
- **Isaiah 42:15**
I will lay waste the mountains and hills and dry up all their vegetation. I will turn the rivers into dry land and drain the marshes.
- **Isaiah 42:16**
I will lead the blind by a way they did not know; I will guide them on unfamiliar paths. I will turn darkness into light before them and rough places into level ground. These things I will do for them, and I will not forsake them.
- **Isaiah 42:17**
But those who trust in idols and say to molten images, ‘You are our gods!’ will be turned back in utter shame.
- **Isaiah 42:18**
Listen, you deaf ones; look, you blind ones, that you may see!
- **Isaiah 42:19**
Who is blind but My servant, or deaf like the messenger I am sending? Who is blind like My covenant partner, or blind like the servant of the LORD?
- **Isaiah 42:20**
Though seeing many things, you do not keep watch. Though your ears are open, you do not hear.”
- **Isaiah 42:21**
The LORD was pleased, for the sake of His righteousness, to magnify His law and make it glorious.
- **Isaiah 42:22**
But this is a people plundered and looted, all trapped in caves or imprisoned in dungeons. They have become plunder with no one to rescue them, and loot with no one to say, “Send them back!”
- **Isaiah 42:23**
Who among you will pay attention to this? Who will listen and obey hereafter?
- **Isaiah 42:24**
Who gave Jacob up for spoil, and Israel to the plunderers? Was it not the LORD, against whom we have sinned? They were unwilling to walk in His ways, and they would not obey His law.
- **Isaiah 42:25**
So He poured out on them His furious anger and the fierceness of battle. It enveloped them in flames, but they did not understand; it consumed them, but they did not take it to heart.
- **Isaiah 43:1**
Now this is what the LORD says—He who created you, O Jacob, and He who formed you, O Israel: “Do not fear, for I have redeemed you; I have called you by your name; you are Mine!
- **Isaiah 43:2**
When you pass through the waters, I will be with you; and when you go through the rivers, they will not overwhelm you. When you walk through the fire, you will not be scorched; the flames will not set you ablaze.
- **Isaiah 43:3**
For I am the LORD your God, the Holy One of Israel, your Savior; I give Egypt for your ransom, Cush and Seba in your place.
- **Isaiah 43:4**
Because you are precious and honored in My sight, and because I love you, I will give men in exchange for you and nations in place of your life.
- **Isaiah 43:5**
Do not be afraid, for I am with you; I will bring your offspring from the east and gather you from the west.
- **Isaiah 43:6**
I will say to the north, ‘Give them up!’ and to the south, ‘Do not hold them back!’ Bring My sons from afar, and My daughters from the ends of the earth—
- **Isaiah 43:7**
everyone called by My name and created for My glory, whom I have indeed formed and made.”
- **Isaiah 43:8**
Bring out a people who have eyes but are blind, and who have ears but are deaf.
- **Isaiah 43:9**
All the nations gather together and the peoples assemble. Who among them can declare this, and proclaim to us the former things? Let them present their witnesses to vindicate them, so that others may hear and say, “It is true.”
- **Isaiah 43:10**
“You are My witnesses,” declares the LORD, “and My servant whom I have chosen, so that you may consider and believe Me and understand that I am He. Before Me no god was formed, and after Me none will come.
- **Isaiah 43:11**
I, yes I, am the LORD, and there is no Savior but Me.
- **Isaiah 43:12**
I alone decreed and saved and proclaimed—I, and not some foreign god among you. So you are My witnesses,” declares the LORD, “that I am God.
- **Isaiah 43:13**
Even from eternity I am He, and none can deliver out of My hand. When I act, who can reverse it?”
- **Isaiah 43:14**
Thus says the LORD your Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel: “For your sake, I will send to Babylon and bring them all as fugitives, even the Chaldeans, in the ships in which they rejoice.
- **Isaiah 43:15**
I am the LORD, your Holy One, the Creator of Israel, and your King.”
- **Isaiah 43:16**
Thus says the LORD, who makes a way in the sea and a path through the surging waters,
- **Isaiah 43:17**
who brings out the chariots and horses, the armies and warriors together, to lie down, never to rise again; to be extinguished, snuffed out like a wick:
- **Isaiah 43:18**
“Do not call to mind the former things; pay no attention to the things of old.
- **Isaiah 43:19**
Behold, I am about to do something new; even now it is coming. Do you not see it? Indeed, I will make a way in the wilderness and streams in the desert.
- **Isaiah 43:20**
The beasts of the field will honor Me, the jackals and the ostriches, because I provide water in the wilderness and rivers in the desert, to give drink to My chosen people.
- **Isaiah 43:21**
The people I formed for Myself will declare My praise.
- **Isaiah 43:22**
But you have not called on Me, O Jacob, because you have grown weary of Me, O Israel.
- **Isaiah 43:23**
You have not brought Me sheep for burnt offerings, nor honored Me with your sacrifices. I have not burdened you with offerings, nor wearied you with frankincense.
- **Isaiah 43:24**
You have not bought Me sweet cane with your silver, nor satisfied Me with the fat of your sacrifices. But you have burdened Me with your sins; you have wearied Me with your iniquities.
- **Isaiah 43:25**
I, yes I, am He who blots out your transgressions for My own sake and remembers your sins no more.
- **Isaiah 43:26**
Remind Me, let us argue the matter together. State your case, so that you may be vindicated.
- **Isaiah 43:27**
Your first father sinned, and your spokesmen rebelled against Me.
- **Isaiah 43:28**
So I will disgrace the princes of your sanctuary, and I will devote Jacob to destruction and Israel to reproach.”
- **Isaiah 44:1**
But now listen, O Jacob My servant, Israel, whom I have chosen.
- **Isaiah 44:2**
This is the word of the LORD, your Maker, who formed you from the womb and who will help you: “Do not be afraid, O Jacob My servant, Jeshurun, whom I have chosen.
- **Isaiah 44:3**
For I will pour water on the thirsty land, and currents on the dry ground. I will pour out My Spirit on your descendants, and My blessing on your offspring.
- **Isaiah 44:4**
They will sprout among the grass like willows by flowing streams.
- **Isaiah 44:5**
One will say, ‘I belong to the LORD,’ another will call himself by the name of Jacob, and still another will write on his hand, ‘The LORD’s,’ and will take the name of Israel.”
- **Isaiah 44:6**
Thus says the LORD, the King and Redeemer of Israel, the LORD of Hosts: “I am the first and I am the last, and there is no God but Me.
- **Isaiah 44:7**
Who then is like Me? Let him say so! Let him declare his case before Me, since I established an ancient people. Let him foretell the things to come, and what is to take place.
- **Isaiah 44:8**
Do not tremble or fear. Have I not told you and declared it long ago? You are My witnesses! Is there any God but Me? There is no other Rock; I know not one.”
- **Isaiah 44:9**
All makers of idols are nothing, and the things they treasure are worthless. Their witnesses fail to see or comprehend, so they are put to shame.
- **Isaiah 44:10**
Who fashions a god or casts an idol which profits him nothing?
- **Isaiah 44:11**
Behold, all his companions will be put to shame, for the craftsmen themselves are only human. Let them all assemble and take their stand; they will all be brought to terror and shame.
- **Isaiah 44:12**
The blacksmith takes a tool and labors over the coals; he fashions an idol with hammers and forges it with his strong arms. Yet he grows hungry and loses his strength; he fails to drink water and grows faint.
- **Isaiah 44:13**
The woodworker extends a measuring line; he marks it out with a stylus; he shapes it with chisels and outlines it with a compass. He fashions it in the likeness of man, like man in all his glory, that it may dwell in a shrine.
- **Isaiah 44:14**
He cuts down cedars or retrieves a cypress or oak. He lets it grow strong among the trees of the forest. He plants a laurel, and the rain makes it grow.
- **Isaiah 44:15**
It serves as fuel for man. He takes some of it to warm himself, and he kindles a fire and bakes his bread; he even fashions it into a god and worships it; he makes an idol and bows down to it.
- **Isaiah 44:16**
He burns half of it in the fire, and he roasts meat on that half. He eats the roast and is satisfied. Indeed, he warms himself and says, “Ah! I am warm; I see the fire.”
- **Isaiah 44:17**
From the rest he makes a god, his graven image. He bows down to it and worships; he prays to it and says, “Save me, for you are my god.”
- **Isaiah 44:18**
They do not comprehend or discern, for He has shut their eyes so they cannot see and closed their minds so they cannot understand.
- **Isaiah 44:19**
And no one considers in his heart, no one has the knowledge or insight to say, “I burned half of it in the fire, and I baked bread on its coals; I roasted meat and I ate. Shall I make something detestable with the rest of it? Shall I bow down to a block of wood?”
- **Isaiah 44:20**
He feeds on ashes. His deluded heart has led him astray, and he cannot deliver himself or say, “Is not this thing in my right hand a lie?”
- **Isaiah 44:21**
Remember these things, O Jacob, for you are My servant, O Israel. I have made you, and you are My servant; O Israel, I will never forget you.
- **Isaiah 44:22**
I have blotted out your transgressions like a cloud, and your sins like a mist. Return to Me, for I have redeemed you.
- **Isaiah 44:23**
Sing for joy, O heavens, for the LORD has done this; shout aloud, O depths of the earth. Break forth in song, O mountains, you forests and all your trees. For the LORD has redeemed Jacob, and revealed His glory in Israel.
- **Isaiah 44:24**
Thus says the LORD, your Redeemer who formed you from the womb: “I am the LORD, who has made all things, who alone stretched out the heavens, who by Myself spread out the earth,
- **Isaiah 44:25**
who foils the signs of false prophets and makes fools of diviners, who confounds the wise and turns their knowledge into nonsense,
- **Isaiah 44:26**
who confirms the message of His servant and fulfills the counsel of His messengers, who says of Jerusalem, ‘She will be inhabited,’ and of the cities of Judah, ‘They will be rebuilt, and I will restore their ruins,’
- **Isaiah 44:27**
who says to the depths of the sea, ‘Be dry, and I will dry up your currents,’
- **Isaiah 44:28**
who says of Cyrus, ‘My shepherd will fulfill all that I desire,’ who says of Jerusalem, ‘She will be rebuilt,’ and of the temple, ‘Let its foundation be laid.’”
- **Isaiah 45:1**
This is what the LORD says to Cyrus His anointed, whose right hand I have grasped to subdue nations before him, to disarm kings, to open the doors before him, so that the gates will not be shut:
- **Isaiah 45:2**
“I will go before you and level the mountains; I will break down the gates of bronze and cut through the bars of iron.
- **Isaiah 45:3**
I will give you the treasures of darkness and the riches hidden in secret places, so that you may know that I am the LORD, the God of Israel, who calls you by name.
- **Isaiah 45:4**
For the sake of Jacob My servant and Israel My chosen one, I call you by name; I have given you a title of honor, though you have not known Me.
- **Isaiah 45:5**
I am the LORD, and there is no other; there is no God but Me. I will equip you for battle, though you have not known Me,
- **Isaiah 45:6**
so that all may know, from where the sun rises to where it sets, that there is none but Me; I am the LORD, and there is no other.
- **Isaiah 45:7**
I form the light and create the darkness; I bring prosperity and create calamity. I, the LORD, do all these things.
- **Isaiah 45:8**
Drip down, O heavens, from above, and let the skies pour down righteousness. Let the earth open up that salvation may sprout and righteousness spring up with it; I, the LORD, have created it.
- **Isaiah 45:9**
Woe to him who quarrels with his Maker—one clay pot among many. Does the clay ask the potter, ‘What are you making?’ Does your work say, ‘He has no hands’?
- **Isaiah 45:10**
Woe to him who says to his father, ‘What have you begotten?’ or to his mother, ‘What have you brought forth?’”
- **Isaiah 45:11**
Thus says the LORD, the Holy One of Israel, and its Maker: “How dare you question Me about My sons, or instruct Me in the work of My hands?
- **Isaiah 45:12**
It is I who made the earth and created man upon it. It was My hands that stretched out the heavens, and I ordained all their host.
- **Isaiah 45:13**
I will raise up Cyrus in righteousness, and I will make all his ways straight. He will rebuild My city and set My exiles free, but not for payment or reward, says the LORD of Hosts.”
- **Isaiah 45:14**
This is what the LORD says: “The products of Egypt and the merchandise of Cush, along with the Sabeans, men of stature, will come over to you and will be yours; they will trudge behind you; they will come over in chains and bow down to you. They will confess to you: ‘God is indeed with you, and there is no other; there is no other God.’”
- **Isaiah 45:15**
Truly You are a God who hides Himself, O God of Israel, the Savior.
- **Isaiah 45:16**
They will all be put to shame and humiliated; the makers of idols will depart together in disgrace.
- **Isaiah 45:17**
But Israel will be saved by the LORD with an everlasting salvation; you will not be put to shame or humiliated, to ages everlasting.
- **Isaiah 45:18**
For thus says the LORD, who created the heavens—He is God; He formed the earth and fashioned it; He established it; He did not create it to be empty, but formed it to be inhabited: “I am the LORD, and there is no other.
- **Isaiah 45:19**
I have not spoken in secret, from a place in a land of darkness. I did not say to the descendants of Jacob, ‘Seek Me in a wasteland.’ I, the LORD, speak the truth; I say what is right.
- **Isaiah 45:20**
Come, gather together, and draw near, you fugitives from the nations. Ignorant are those who carry idols of wood and pray to a god that cannot save.
- **Isaiah 45:21**
Speak up and present your case—yes, let them take counsel together. Who foretold this long ago? Who announced it from ancient times? Was it not I, the LORD? There is no other God but Me, a righteous God and Savior; there is none but Me.
- **Isaiah 45:22**
Turn to Me and be saved, all the ends of the earth; for I am God, and there is no other.

- **Isaiah 56:3**
Let no foreigner who has joined himself to the LORD say, “The LORD will utterly exclude me from His people.” And let the eunuch not say, “I am but a dry tree.”
- **Isaiah 56:4**
For this is what the LORD says: “To the eunuchs who keep My Sabbaths, who choose what pleases Me and hold fast to My covenant—
- **Isaiah 56:5**
I will give them, in My house and within My walls, a memorial and a name better than that of sons and daughters. I will give them an everlasting name that will not be cut off.
- **Isaiah 56:6**
And the foreigners who join themselves to the LORD to minister to Him, to love the name of the LORD, and to be His servants—all who keep the Sabbath without profaning it and who hold fast to My covenant—
- **Isaiah 56:7**
I will bring them to My holy mountain and make them joyful in My house of prayer. Their burnt offerings and sacrifices will be accepted on My altar, for My house will be called a house of prayer for all the nations.”
- **Isaiah 56:8**
Thus declares the Lord GOD, who gathers the dispersed of Israel: “I will gather to them still others besides those already gathered.”
- **Isaiah 56:9**
Come, all you beasts of the field; eat greedily, all you beasts of the forest.
- **Isaiah 56:10**
Israel’s watchmen are blind, they are all oblivious; they are all mute dogs, they cannot bark; they are dreamers lying around, loving to slumber.
- **Isaiah 56:11**
Like ravenous dogs, they are never satisfied. They are shepherds with no discernment; they all turn to their own way, each one seeking his own gain:
- **Isaiah 56:12**
“Come, let me get the wine, let us imbibe the strong drink, and tomorrow will be like today, only far better!”
- **Isaiah 57:1**
The righteous perish, and no one takes it to heart; devout men are swept away, while no one considers that the righteous are guided from the presence of evil.
- **Isaiah 57:2**
Those who walk uprightly enter into peace; they find rest, lying down in death.
- **Isaiah 57:3**
“But come here, you sons of a sorceress, you offspring of adulterers and prostitutes!
- **Isaiah 57:4**
Whom are you mocking? At whom do you snarl and stick out your tongue? Are you not children of transgression, offspring of deceit,
- **Isaiah 57:5**
who burn with lust among the oaks, under every luxuriant tree, who slaughter your children in the valleys, under the clefts of the rocks?
- **Isaiah 57:6**
Your portion is among the smooth stones of the valley; indeed, they are your lot. Even to them you have poured out a drink offering and offered a grain offering. Should I relent because of these?
- **Isaiah 57:7**
On a high and lofty hill you have made your bed, and there you went up to offer sacrifices.
- **Isaiah 57:8**
Behind the door and doorpost you have set up your memorial. Forsaking Me, you uncovered your bed; you climbed up and opened it wide. And you have made a pact with those whose bed you have loved; you have gazed upon their nakedness.
- **Isaiah 57:9**
You went to Molech with oil and multiplied your perfumes. You have sent your envoys a great distance; you have descended even to Sheol itself.
- **Isaiah 57:10**
You are wearied by your many journeys, but you did not say, “There is no hope!” You found renewal of your strength; therefore you did not grow weak.
- **Isaiah 57:11**
Whom have you dreaded and feared, so that you lied and failed to remember Me or take this to heart? Is it not because I have long been silent that you do not fear Me?
- **Isaiah 57:12**
I will expose your righteousness and your works, and they will not profit you.
- **Isaiah 57:13**
When you cry out, let your companies of idols deliver you! Yet the wind will carry off all of them, a breath will take them away. But he who seeks refuge in Me will inherit the land and possess My holy mountain.”
- **Isaiah 57:14**
And it will be said, “Build it up, build it up, prepare the way, take every obstacle out of the way of My people.”
- **Isaiah 57:15**
For thus says the One who is high and lifted up, who inhabits eternity, whose name is Holy: “I dwell in a high and holy place, and with the oppressed and humble in spirit, to restore the spirit of the lowly and revive the heart of the contrite.
- **Isaiah 57:16**
For I will not accuse you forever, nor will I always be angry; for then the spirit of man would grow weak before Me, with the breath of those I have made.
- **Isaiah 57:17**
I was enraged by his sinful greed, so I struck him and hid My face in anger; yet he kept turning back to the desires of his heart.
- **Isaiah 57:18**
I have seen his ways, but I will heal him; I will guide him and restore comfort to him and his mourners,
- **Isaiah 57:19**
bringing praise to their lips. Peace, peace to those far and near,” says the LORD, “and I will heal them.”
- **Isaiah 57:20**
But the wicked are like the storm-tossed sea, for it cannot be still, and its waves churn up mire and muck.
- **Isaiah 57:21**
“There is no peace,” says my God, “for the wicked.”
- **Isaiah 58:1**
“Cry aloud, do not hold back! Raise your voice like a ram’s horn. Declare to My people their transgression and to the house of Jacob their sins.
- **Isaiah 58:2**
For day after day they seek Me and delight to know My ways, like a nation that does what is right and does not forsake the justice of their God. They ask Me for righteous judgments; they delight in the nearness of God.”
- **Isaiah 58:3**
“Why have we fasted, and You have not seen? Why have we humbled ourselves, and You have not noticed?” “Behold, on the day of your fast, you do as you please, and you oppress all your workers.
- **Isaiah 58:4**
You fast with contention and strife to strike viciously with your fist. You cannot fast as you do today and have your voice be heard on high.
- **Isaiah 58:5**
Is this the fast I have chosen: a day for a man to deny himself, to bow his head like a reed, and to spread out sackcloth and ashes? Will you call this a fast and a day acceptable to the LORD?
- **Isaiah 58:6**
Isn’t this the fast that I have chosen: to break the chains of wickedness, to untie the cords of the yoke, to set the oppressed free and tear off every yoke?
- **Isaiah 58:7**
Isn’t it to share your bread with the hungry, to bring the poor and homeless into your home, to clothe the naked when you see him, and not to turn away from your own flesh and blood?
- **Isaiah 58:8**
Then your light will break forth like the dawn, and your healing will come quickly. Your righteousness will go before you, and the glory of the LORD will be your rear guard.
- **Isaiah 58:9**
Then you will call, and the LORD will answer; you will cry out, and He will say, ‘Here I am.’ If you remove the yoke from your midst, the pointing of the finger and malicious talk,
- **Isaiah 58:10**
and if you give yourself to the hungry and satisfy the afflicted soul, then your light will go forth in the darkness, and your night will be like noonday.
- **Isaiah 58:11**
The LORD will always guide you; He will satisfy you in a sun-scorched land and strengthen your frame. You will be like a well-watered garden, like a spring whose waters never fail.
- **Isaiah 58:12**
Your people will rebuild the ancient ruins; you will restore the age-old foundations; you will be called Repairer of the Breach, Restorer of the Streets of Dwelling.
- **Isaiah 58:13**
If you turn your foot from breaking the Sabbath, from doing as you please on My holy day, if you call the Sabbath a delight, and the LORD’s holy day honorable, if you honor it by not going your own way or seeking your own pleasure or speaking idle words,
- **Isaiah 58:14**
then you will delight yourself in the LORD, and I will make you ride on the heights of the land and feed you with the heritage of your father Jacob.” For the mouth of the LORD has spoken.
- **Isaiah 59:1**
Surely the arm of the LORD is not too short to save, nor His ear too dull to hear.
- **Isaiah 59:2**
But your iniquities have built barriers between you and your God, and your sins have hidden His face from you, so that He does not hear.
- **Isaiah 59:3**
For your hands are stained with blood, and your fingers with iniquity; your lips have spoken lies, and your tongue mutters injustice.
- **Isaiah 59:4**
No one calls for justice; no one pleads his case honestly. They rely on empty pleas; they tell lies; they conceive mischief and give birth to iniquity.
- **Isaiah 59:5**
They hatch the eggs of vipers and weave a spider’s web. Whoever eats their eggs will die; crack one open, and a viper is hatched.
- **Isaiah 59:6**
Their cobwebs cannot be made into clothing, and they cannot cover themselves with their works. Their deeds are sinful deeds, and acts of violence are in their hands.
- **Isaiah 59:7**
Their feet run to evil; they are swift to shed innocent blood. Their thoughts are sinful thoughts; ruin and destruction lie in their wake.
- **Isaiah 59:8**
The way of peace they have not known, and there is no justice in their tracks. They have turned them into crooked paths; no one who treads on them will know peace.
- **Isaiah 59:9**
Therefore justice is far from us, and righteousness does not reach us. We hope for light, but there is darkness; for brightness, but we walk in gloom.
- **Isaiah 59:10**
Like the blind, we feel our way along the wall, groping like those without eyes. We stumble at midday as in the twilight; among the vigorous we are like the dead.
- **Isaiah 59:11**
We all growl like bears and moan like doves. We hope for justice, but find none, for salvation, but it is far from us.
- **Isaiah 59:12**
For our transgressions are multiplied before You, and our sins testify against us. Our transgressions are indeed with us, and we know our iniquities:
- **Isaiah 59:13**
rebelling and denying the LORD, turning away from our God, speaking oppression and revolt, conceiving and uttering lies from the heart.
- **Isaiah 59:14**
So justice is turned away, and righteousness stands at a distance. For truth has stumbled in the public square, and honesty cannot enter.
- **Isaiah 59:15**
Truth is missing, and whoever turns from evil becomes prey. The LORD looked and was displeased that there was no justice.
- **Isaiah 59:16**
He saw that there was no man; He was amazed that there was no one to intercede. So His own arm brought salvation, and His own righteousness sustained Him.
- **Isaiah 59:17**
He put on righteousness like a breastplate, and the helmet of salvation on His head; He put on garments of vengeance and wrapped Himself in a cloak of zeal.
- **Isaiah 59:18**
So He will repay according to their deeds: fury to His enemies, retribution to His foes, and recompense to the islands.
- **Isaiah 59:19**
So shall they fear the name of the LORD where the sun sets, and His glory where it rises. For He will come like a raging flood, driven by the breath of the LORD.
- **Isaiah 59:20**
“The Redeemer will come to Zion, to those in Jacob who turn from transgression,” declares the LORD.
- **Isaiah 59:21**
“As for Me, this is My covenant with them,” says the LORD. “My Spirit will not depart from you, and My words that I have put in your mouth will not depart from your mouth or from the mouths of your children and grandchildren, from now on and forevermore,” says the LORD.
- **Isaiah 60:1**
Arise, shine, for your light has come, and the glory of the LORD rises upon you.
- **Isaiah 60:2**
For behold, darkness covers the earth, and thick darkness is over the peoples; but the LORD will rise upon you, and His glory will appear over you.
- **Isaiah 60:3**
Nations will come to your light, and kings to the brightness of your dawn.
- **Isaiah 60:4**
Lift up your eyes and look around: They all gather and come to you; your sons will come from afar, and your daughters will be carried on the arm.
- **Isaiah 60:5**
Then you will look and be radiant, and your heart will tremble and swell with joy, because the riches of the sea will be brought to you, and the wealth of the nations will come to you.
- **Isaiah 60:6**
Caravans of camels will cover your land, young camels of Midian and Ephah, and all from Sheba will come, bearing gold and frankincense and proclaiming the praises of the LORD.
- **Isaiah 60:7**
All the flocks of Kedar will be gathered to you; the rams of Nebaioth will serve you and go up on My altar with acceptance; I will adorn My glorious house.
- **Isaiah 60:8**
Who are these who fly like clouds, like doves to their shelters?
- **Isaiah 60:9**
Surely the islands will wait for Me, with the ships of Tarshish in the lead, to bring your children from afar, with their silver and gold, to the honor of the LORD your God, the Holy One of Israel, for He has glorified you.
- **Isaiah 60:10**
Foreigners will rebuild your walls, and their kings will serve you. Although I struck you in anger, yet in favor I will show you mercy.
- **Isaiah 60:11**
Your gates will always stand open; they will never be shut, day or night, so that the wealth of the nations may be brought into you, with their kings being led in procession.
- **Isaiah 60:12**
For the nation or kingdom that will not serve you will perish; it will be utterly destroyed.
- **Isaiah 60:13**
The glory of Lebanon will come to you—its cypress, elm, and boxwood together—to adorn the place of My sanctuary, and I will glorify the place of My feet.
- **Isaiah 60:14**
The sons of your oppressors will come and bow down to you; all who reviled you will fall facedown at your feet and call you the City of the LORD, Zion of the Holy One of Israel.
- **Isaiah 60:15**
Whereas you have been forsaken and despised, with no one passing through, I will make you an everlasting pride, a joy from age to age.
- **Isaiah 60:16**
You will drink the milk of nations and nurse at the breasts of royalty; you will know that I, the LORD, am your Savior and your Redeemer, the Mighty One of Jacob.
- **Isaiah 60:17**
Instead of bronze I will bring you gold; I will bring silver in place of iron, bronze instead of wood, and iron instead of stones. I will appoint peace as your governor and righteousness as your ruler.
- **Isaiah 60:18**
No longer will violence be heard in your land, nor ruin or destruction within your borders. But you will name your walls Salvation and your gates Praise.
- **Isaiah 60:19**
No longer will the sun be your light by day, nor the brightness of the moon shine on your night; for the LORD will be your everlasting light, and your God will be your splendor.
- **Isaiah 60:20**
Your sun will no longer set, and your moon will not wane; for the LORD will be your everlasting light, and the days of your sorrow will cease.
- **Isaiah 60:21**
Then all your people will be righteous; they will possess the land forever; they are the branch of My planting, the work of My hands, so that I may be glorified.
- **Isaiah 60:22**
The least of you will become a thousand, and the smallest a mighty nation. I am the LORD; in its time I will accomplish it quickly.
- **Isaiah 61:1**
The Spirit of the Lord GOD is on Me, because the LORD has anointed Me to preach good news to the poor. He has sent Me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives and freedom to the prisoners,
- **Isaiah 61:2**
to proclaim the year of the LORD’s favor and the day of our God’s vengeance, to comfort all who mourn,
- **Isaiah 61:3**
to console the mourners in Zion—to give them a crown of beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, and a garment of praise for a spirit of despair. So they will be called oaks of righteousness, the planting of the LORD, that He may be glorified.
- **Isaiah 61:4**
They will rebuild the ancient ruins; they will restore the places long devastated; they will renew the ruined cities, the desolations of many generations.
- **Isaiah 61:5**
Strangers will stand and feed your flocks, and foreigners will be your plowmen and vinedressers.
- **Isaiah 61:6**
But you will be called the priests of the LORD; they will speak of you as ministers of our God; you will feed on the wealth of nations, and you will boast in their riches.
- **Isaiah 61:7**
Instead of shame, My people will have a double portion, and instead of humiliation, they will rejoice in their share; and so they will inherit a double portion in their land, and everlasting joy will be theirs.
- **Isaiah 61:8**
For I, the LORD, love justice; I hate robbery and iniquity; in My faithfulness I will give them their recompense and make an everlasting covenant with them.
- **Isaiah 61:9**
Their descendants will be known among the nations, and their offspring among the peoples. All who see them will acknowledge that they are a people the LORD has blessed.
- **Isaiah 61:10**
I will rejoice greatly in the LORD, my soul will exult in my God; for He has clothed me with garments of salvation and wrapped me in a robe of righteousness, as a bridegroom wears a priestly headdress, as a bride adorns herself with her jewels.
- **Isaiah 61:11**
For as the earth brings forth its growth, and as a garden enables seed to spring up, so the Lord GOD will cause righteousness and praise to spring up before all the nations.
- **Isaiah 62:1**
For Zion’s sake I will not keep silent, and for Jerusalem’s sake I will not keep still, until her righteousness shines like a bright light, her salvation like a blazing torch.
- **Isaiah 62:2**
Nations will see your righteousness, and all kings your glory. You will be called by a new name that the mouth of the LORD will bestow.
- **Isaiah 62:3**
You will be a crown of glory in the hand of the LORD, a royal diadem in the palm of your God.
- **Isaiah 62:4**
No longer will you be called Forsaken, nor your land named Desolate; but you will be called Hephzibah, and your land Beulah; for the LORD will take delight in you, and your land will be His bride.
- **Isaiah 62:5**
For as a young man marries a young woman, so your sons will marry you; and as a bridegroom rejoices over his bride, so your God will rejoice over you.
- **Isaiah 62:6**
On your walls, O Jerusalem, I have posted watchmen; they will never be silent day or night. You who call on the LORD shall take no rest for yourselves,
- **Isaiah 62:7**
nor give Him any rest until He establishes Jerusalem and makes her the praise of the earth.
- **Isaiah 62:8**
The LORD has sworn by His right hand and by His mighty arm: “Never again will I give your grain to your enemies for food, nor will foreigners drink the new wine for which you have toiled.
- **Isaiah 62:9**
For those who harvest grain will eat it and praise the LORD, and those who gather grapes will drink the wine in My holy courts.”
- **Isaiah 62:10**
Go out, go out through the gates; prepare the way for the people! Build it up, build up the highway; clear away the stones; raise a banner for the nations!
- **Isaiah 62:11**
Behold, the LORD has proclaimed to the ends of the earth, “Say to Daughter Zion: See, your Savior comes! Look, His reward is with Him, and His recompense goes before Him.”
- **Isaiah 62:12**
And they will be called the Holy People, the Redeemed of The LORD; and you will be called Sought Out, A City Not Forsaken.
- **Isaiah 63:1**
Who is this coming from Edom, from Bozrah with crimson-stained garments? Who is this robed in splendor, marching in the greatness of His strength? “It is I, proclaiming vindication, mighty to save.”
- **Isaiah 63:2**
Why are Your clothes red, and Your garments like one who treads the winepress?
- **Isaiah 63:3**
“I have trodden the winepress alone, and no one from the nations was with Me. I trampled them in My anger and trod them down in My fury; their blood spattered My garments, and all My clothes were stained.
- **Isaiah 63:4**
For the day of vengeance was in My heart, and the year of My redemption had come.
- **Isaiah 63:5**
I looked, but there was no one to help; I was appalled that no one assisted. So My arm brought Me salvation, and My own wrath upheld Me.
- **Isaiah 63:6**
I trampled the nations in My anger; in My wrath I made them drunk and poured out their blood on the ground.”
- **Isaiah 63:7**
I will make known the LORD’s loving devotion and His praiseworthy acts, because of all that the LORD has done for us—the many good things for the house of Israel according to His great compassion and loving devotion.
- **Isaiah 63:8**
For He said, “They are surely My people, sons who will not be disloyal.” So He became their Savior.
- **Isaiah 63:9**
In all their distress, He too was afflicted, and the Angel of His Presence saved them. In His love and compassion He redeemed them; He lifted them up and carried them all the days of old.
- **Isaiah 63:10**
But they rebelled and grieved His Holy Spirit. So He turned and became their enemy, and He Himself fought against them.
- **Isaiah 63:11**
Then His people remembered the days of old, the days of Moses. Where is He who brought them through the sea with the shepherds of His flock? Where is the One who set His Holy Spirit among them,
- **Isaiah 63:12**
who sent His glorious arm to lead them by the right hand of Moses, who divided the waters before them to gain for Himself everlasting renown,
- **Isaiah 63:13**
who led them through the depths like a horse in the wilderness, so that they did not stumble?
- **Isaiah 63:14**
Like cattle going down to the valley, the Spirit of the LORD gave them rest. You led Your people this way to make for Yourself a glorious name.
- **Isaiah 63:15**
Look down from heaven and see, from Your holy and glorious habitation. Where are Your zeal and might? Your yearning and compassion for me are restrained.
- **Isaiah 63:16**
Yet You are our Father, though Abraham does not know us and Israel does not acknowledge us. You, O LORD, are our Father; our Redeemer from Everlasting is Your name.
- **Isaiah 63:17**
Why, O LORD, do You make us stray from Your ways and harden our hearts from fearing You? Return, for the sake of Your servants, the tribes of Your heritage.
- **Isaiah 63:18**
For a short while Your people possessed Your holy place, but our enemies have trampled Your sanctuary.
- **Isaiah 63:19**
We have become like those You never ruled, like those not called by Your name.
- **Isaiah 64:1**
If only You would rend the heavens and come down, so that mountains would quake at Your presence,
- **Isaiah 64:2**
as fire kindles the brushwood and causes the water to boil, to make Your name known to Your enemies, so that the nations will tremble at Your presence!
- **Isaiah 64:3**
When You did awesome works that we did not expect, You came down, and the mountains trembled at Your presence.
- **Isaiah 64:4**
From ancient times no one has heard, no ear has perceived, no eye has seen any God besides You, who acts on behalf of those who wait for Him.
- **Isaiah 64:5**
You welcome those who gladly do right, who remember Your ways. Surely You were angry, for we sinned. How can we be saved if we remain in our sins?
- **Isaiah 64:6**
Each of us has become like something unclean, and all our righteous acts are like filthy rags; we all wither like a leaf, and our iniquities carry us away like the wind.
- **Isaiah 64:7**
No one calls on Your name or strives to take hold of You. For You have hidden Your face from us and delivered us into the hand of our iniquity.
- **Isaiah 64:8**
But now, O LORD, You are our Father; we are the clay, and You are the potter; we are all the work of Your hand.
- **Isaiah 64:9**
Do not be angry, O LORD, beyond measure; do not remember our iniquity forever. Oh, look upon us, we pray; we are all Your people!
- **Isaiah 64:10**
Your holy cities have become a wilderness. Zion has become a wasteland and Jerusalem a desolation.
- **Isaiah 64:11**
Our holy and beautiful temple, where our fathers praised You, has been burned with fire, and all that was dear to us lies in ruins.
- **Isaiah 64:12**
After all this, O LORD, will You restrain Yourself? Will You keep silent and afflict us beyond measure?
- **Isaiah 65:1**
“I revealed Myself to those who did not ask for Me; I was found by those who did not seek Me. To a nation that did not call My name, I said, ‘Here I am! Here I am!’
- **Isaiah 65:2**
All day long I have held out My hands to an obstinate people who walk in the wrong path, who follow their own imaginations,
- **Isaiah 65:3**
to a people who continually provoke Me to My face, sacrificing in the gardens and burning incense on altars of brick,
- **Isaiah 65:4**
sitting among the graves, spending nights in secret places, eating the meat of pigs and polluted broth from their bowls.
- **Isaiah 65:5**
They say, ‘Keep to yourself; do not come near me, for I am holier than you!’ Such people are smoke in My nostrils, a fire that burns all day long.
- **Isaiah 65:6**
Behold, it is written before Me: I will not keep silent, but I will repay; I will pay it back into their laps,
- **Isaiah 65:7**
both for your iniquities and for those of your fathers,” says the LORD. “Because they burned incense on the mountains and scorned Me on the hills, I will measure into their laps full payment for their former deeds.”
- **Isaiah 65:8**
This is what the LORD says: “As the new wine is found in a cluster of grapes, and men say, ‘Do not destroy it, for it contains a blessing,’ so I will act on behalf of My servants; I will not destroy them all.
- **Isaiah 65:9**
And I will bring forth descendants from Jacob, and heirs from Judah; My elect will possess My mountains, and My servants will dwell there.
- **Isaiah 65:10**
Sharon will become a pasture for flocks, and the Valley of Achor a resting place for herds, for My people who seek Me.
- **Isaiah 65:11**
But you who forsake the LORD, who forget My holy mountain, who set a table for Fortune and fill bowls of mixed wine for Destiny,
- **Isaiah 65:12**
I will destine you for the sword, and you will all kneel down to be slaughtered, because I called and you did not answer, I spoke and you did not listen; you did evil in My sight and chose that in which I did not delight.”
- **Isaiah 65:13**
Therefore this is what the Lord GOD says: “My servants will eat, but you will go hungry; My servants will drink, but you will go thirsty; My servants will rejoice, but you will be put to shame.
- **Isaiah 65:14**
My servants will shout for joy with a glad heart, but you will cry out with a heavy heart and wail with a broken spirit.
- **Isaiah 65:15**
You will leave behind your name as a curse for My chosen ones, and the Lord GOD will slay you; but to His servants He will give another name.
- **Isaiah 65:16**
Whoever invokes a blessing in the land will do so by the God of truth, and whoever takes an oath in the land will swear by the God of truth. For the former troubles will be forgotten and hidden from My sight.
- **Isaiah 65:17**
For behold, I will create new heavens and a new earth. The former things will not be remembered, nor will they come to mind.
- **Isaiah 65:18**
But be glad and rejoice forever in what I create; for I will create Jerusalem to be a joy and its people to be a delight.
- **Isaiah 65:19**
I will rejoice in Jerusalem and take delight in My people. The sounds of weeping and crying will no longer be heard in her.
- **Isaiah 65:20**
No longer will a nursing infant live but a few days, or an old man fail to live out his years. For the youth will die at a hundred years, and he who fails to reach a hundred will be considered accursed.
- **Isaiah 65:21**
They will build houses and dwell in them; they will plant vineyards and eat their fruit.
- **Isaiah 65:22**
No longer will they build houses for others to inhabit, nor plant for others to eat. For as is the lifetime of a tree, so will be the days of My people, and My chosen ones will fully enjoy the work of their hands.
- **Isaiah 65:23**
They will not labor in vain or bear children doomed to disaster; for they will be a people blessed by the LORD—they and their descendants with them.
- **Isaiah 65:24**
Even before they call, I will answer, and while they are still speaking, I will hear.
- **Isaiah 65:25**
The wolf and the lamb will feed together, and the lion will eat straw like the ox, but the food of the serpent will be dust. They will neither harm nor destroy on all My holy mountain,” says the LORD.
- **Isaiah 66:1**
This is what the LORD says: “Heaven is My throne, and earth is My footstool. What kind of house will you build for Me? Or where will My place of repose be?
- **Isaiah 66:2**
Has not My hand made all these things? And so they came into being,” declares the LORD. “This is the one I will esteem: he who is humble and contrite in spirit, who trembles at My word.
- **Isaiah 66:3**
Whoever slaughters an ox is like one who slays a man; whoever sacrifices a lamb is like one who breaks a dog’s neck; whoever presents a grain offering is like one who offers pig’s blood; whoever offers frankincense is like one who blesses an idol. Indeed, they have chosen their own ways and delighted in their abominations.
- **Isaiah 66:4**
