Even in times past, while Saul was king, you were the one who led Israel out and brought them back. And the LORD your God said, ‘You will shepherd My people Israel, and you will be ruler over them.’”
- **1 Chronicles 11:3**
So all the elders of Israel came to the king at Hebron, where David made a covenant with them before the LORD. And they anointed him king over Israel, according to the word of the LORD through Samuel.
- **1 Chronicles 11:4**
Then David and all the Israelites marched to Jerusalem (that is, Jebus), where the Jebusites inhabited the land.
- **1 Chronicles 11:5**
The people of Jebus said to David, “You will never get in here.” Nevertheless, David captured the fortress of Zion (that is, the City of David).
- **1 Chronicles 11:6**
Now David had said, “Whoever is the first to strike down a Jebusite will become chief commander.” And Joab son of Zeruiah went up first, and he became the chief.
- **1 Chronicles 11:7**
So David took up residence in the fortress; that is why it was called the City of David.
- **1 Chronicles 11:8**
He built up the city around it, from the supporting terraces to the surrounding wall, while Joab restored the rest of the city.
- **1 Chronicles 11:9**
And David became greater and greater, for the LORD of Hosts was with him.
- **1 Chronicles 11:10**
Now these were the chiefs of David’s mighty men, who, together with all Israel, bolstered and strengthened his kingdom, according to the word of the LORD concerning Israel.
- **1 Chronicles 11:11**
This is the list of David’s mighty men: Jashobeam son of Hachmoni was chief of the officers; he wielded his spear against three hundred men, whom he killed at one time.
- **1 Chronicles 11:12**
Next in command was Eleazar son of Dodo the Ahohite, one of the three mighty men.
- **1 Chronicles 11:13**
He was with David at Pas-dammim when the Philistines gathered there for battle. At the place with a field full of barley, the troops fled from the Philistines.
- **1 Chronicles 11:14**
But Eleazar and David stationed themselves in the middle of the field and defended it. They struck down the Philistines, and the LORD brought about a great victory.
- **1 Chronicles 11:15**
Three of the thirty chief men went down to David, to the rock at the cave of Adullam, while a company of Philistines was encamped in the Valley of Rephaim.
- **1 Chronicles 11:16**
At that time David was in the stronghold, and the garrison of the Philistines was at Bethlehem.
- **1 Chronicles 11:17**
David longed for water and said, “Oh, that someone would get me a drink of water from the well near the gate of Bethlehem!”
- **1 Chronicles 11:18**
So the Three broke through the Philistine camp, drew water from the well at the gate of Bethlehem, and brought it back to David. But he refused to drink it; instead, he poured it out to the LORD,
- **1 Chronicles 11:19**
saying, “Far be it from me, my God, to do this! How can I drink the blood of these men who risked their lives?” Because they had brought it at the risk of their lives, David refused to drink it. Such were the exploits of the three mighty men.
- **1 Chronicles 11:20**
Now Abishai, the brother of Joab, was chief of the Three, and he lifted his spear against three hundred men, killed them, and won a name along with the Three.
- **1 Chronicles 11:21**
He was doubly honored above the Three, and he became their commander, even though he was not included among the Three.
- **1 Chronicles 11:22**
And Benaiah son of Jehoiada was a man of valor from Kabzeel, a man of many exploits. He struck down two champions of Moab, and on a snowy day he went down into a pit and killed a lion.
- **1 Chronicles 11:23**
He also killed an Egyptian, a huge man five cubits tall. Although the Egyptian had a spear like a weaver’s beam in his hand, Benaiah went against him with a club, snatched the spear from his hand, and killed the Egyptian with his own spear.
- **1 Chronicles 11:24**
These were the exploits of Benaiah son of Jehoiada, who won a name alongside the three mighty men.
- **1 Chronicles 11:25**
He was most honored among the Thirty, but he did not become one of the Three. And David appointed him over his guard.
- **1 Chronicles 11:26**
Now these were the mighty men: Asahel the brother of Joab, Elhanan son of Dodo of Bethlehem,
- **1 Chronicles 11:27**
Shammoth the Harorite, Helez the Pelonite,
- **1 Chronicles 11:28**
Ira son of Ikkesh the Tekoite, Abiezer the Anathothite,
- **1 Chronicles 11:29**
Sibbecai the Hushathite, Ilai the Ahohite,
- **1 Chronicles 11:30**
Maharai the Netophathite, Heled son of Baanah the Netophathite,
- **1 Chronicles 11:31**
Ithai son of Ribai from Gibeah of the Benjamites, Benaiah the Pirathonite,
- **1 Chronicles 11:32**
Hurai from the brooks of Gaash, Abiel the Arbathite,
- **1 Chronicles 11:33**
Azmaveth the Baharumite, Eliahba the Shaalbonite,
- **1 Chronicles 11:34**
the sons of Hashem the Gizonite, Jonathan son of Shagee the Hararite,
- **1 Chronicles 11:35**
Ahiam son of Sachar the Hararite, Eliphal son of Ur,
- **1 Chronicles 11:36**
Hepher the Mecherathite, Ahijah the Pelonite,
- **1 Chronicles 11:37**
Hezro the Carmelite, Naarai son of Ezbai,
- **1 Chronicles 11:38**
Joel the brother of Nathan, Mibhar son of Hagri,
- **1 Chronicles 11:39**
Zelek the Ammonite, Naharai the Beerothite, the armor-bearer of Joab son of Zeruiah,
- **1 Chronicles 11:40**
Ira the Ithrite, Gareb the Ithrite,
- **1 Chronicles 11:41**
Uriah the Hittite, Zabad son of Ahlai,
- **1 Chronicles 11:42**
Adina son of Shiza the Reubenite, chief of the Reubenites, and the thirty with him,
- **1 Chronicles 11:43**
Hanan son of Maacah, Joshaphat the Mithnite,
- **1 Chronicles 11:44**
Uzzia the Ashterathite, Shama and Jeiel the sons of Hotham the Aroerite,
- **1 Chronicles 11:45**
Jediael son of Shimri and his brother Joha the Tizite,
- **1 Chronicles 11:46**
Eliel the Mahavite, Jeribai and Joshaviah, the sons of Elnaam, Ithmah the Moabite,
- **1 Chronicles 11:47**
Eliel, Obed, and Jaasiel the Mezobaite.
- **1 Chronicles 12:1**
Now these were the men who came to David at Ziklag, while he was still banished from the presence of Saul son of Kish (they were among the mighty men who helped him in battle;
- **1 Chronicles 12:2**
they were archers using both the right and left hands to sling stones and shoot arrows; and they were Saul’s kinsmen from Benjamin):
- **1 Chronicles 12:3**
Ahiezer their chief and Joash, who were the sons of Shemaah the Gibeathite; Jeziel and Pelet, the sons of Azmaveth; Beracah; Jehu the Anathothite;
- **1 Chronicles 12:4**
Ishmaiah the Gibeonite, a mighty man among the Thirty and a leader over the Thirty; Jeremiah, Jahaziel, Johanan, and Jozabad the Gederathite;
- **1 Chronicles 12:5**
Eluzai, Jerimoth, Bealiah, Shemariah, and Shephatiah the Haruphite;
- **1 Chronicles 12:6**
Elkanah, Isshiah, Azarel, Joezer, and Jashobeam, who were Korahites;
- **1 Chronicles 12:7**
and Joelah and Zebadiah, the sons of Jeroham from Gedor.
- **1 Chronicles 12:8**
Some Gadites defected to David at his stronghold in the desert. They were mighty men of valor, trained for battle, experts with the shield and spear, whose faces were like the faces of lions and who were as swift as gazelles on the mountains:
- **1 Chronicles 12:9**
Ezer the chief, Obadiah the second in command, Eliab the third,
- **1 Chronicles 12:10**
Mishmannah the fourth, Jeremiah the fifth,
- **1 Chronicles 12:11**
Attai the sixth, Eliel the seventh,
- **1 Chronicles 12:12**
Johanan the eighth, Elzabad the ninth,
- **1 Chronicles 12:13**
Jeremiah the tenth, and Machbanai the eleventh.
- **1 Chronicles 12:14**
These Gadites were army commanders, the least of whom was a match for a hundred, and the greatest for a thousand.
- **1 Chronicles 12:15**
These are the ones who crossed the Jordan in the first month when it was overflowing all its banks, and they put to flight all those in the valleys, both to the east and to the west.
- **1 Chronicles 12:16**
Other Benjamites and some men from Judah also came to David in his stronghold.
- **1 Chronicles 12:17**
And David went out to meet them, saying, “If you have come to me in peace to help me, my heart will be united with you; but if you have come to betray me to my enemies when my hands are free of violence, may the God of our fathers see it and judge you.”
- **1 Chronicles 12:18**
Then the Spirit came upon Amasai, the chief of the Thirty, and he said: “We are yours, O David! We are with you, O son of Jesse! Peace, peace to you, and peace to your helpers, for your God helps you.” So David received them and made them leaders of his troops.
- **1 Chronicles 12:19**
Some from Manasseh defected to David when he went with the Philistines to fight against Saul. (They did not help the Philistines because the Philistine rulers consulted and sent David away, saying, “It will cost us our heads if he defects to his master Saul.”)
- **1 Chronicles 12:20**
When David went to Ziklag, these men of Manasseh defected to him: Adnah, Jozabad, Jediael, Michael, Jozabad, Elihu, and Zillethai, chiefs of thousands in Manasseh.
- **1 Chronicles 12:21**
They helped David against the raiders, for they were all mighty men of valor and commanders in the army.
- **1 Chronicles 12:22**
For at that time men came to David day after day to help him, until he had a great army, like the army of God.
- **1 Chronicles 12:23**
Now these are the numbers of men armed for battle who came to David at Hebron to turn Saul’s kingdom over to him, in accordance with the word of the LORD:
- **1 Chronicles 12:24**
From Judah: 6,800 armed troops bearing shields and spears.
- **1 Chronicles 12:25**
From Simeon: 7,100 mighty men of valor, ready for battle.
- **1 Chronicles 12:26**
From Levi: 4,600,
- **1 Chronicles 12:27**
including Jehoiada, leader of the house of Aaron, with 3,700 men,
- **1 Chronicles 12:28**
and Zadok, a mighty young man of valor, with 22 commanders from his own family.
- **1 Chronicles 12:29**
From Benjamin, the kinsmen of Saul: 3,000, most of whom had remained loyal to the house of Saul up to that time.
- **1 Chronicles 12:30**
From Ephraim: 20,800 mighty men of valor, famous among their own clans.
- **1 Chronicles 12:31**
From the half-tribe of Manasseh: 18,000 designated by name to come and make David king.
- **1 Chronicles 12:32**
From Issachar, men who understood the times and knew what Israel should do: 200 chiefs with all their kinsmen at their command.
- **1 Chronicles 12:33**
From Zebulun: 50,000 fit for service, trained for battle with all kinds of weapons of war, who with one purpose were devoted to David.
- **1 Chronicles 12:34**
From Naphtali: 1,000 commanders, accompanied by 37,000 men with shield and spear.
- **1 Chronicles 12:35**
From Dan: 28,600 prepared for battle.
- **1 Chronicles 12:36**
From Asher: 40,000 fit for service, prepared for battle.
- **1 Chronicles 12:37**
And from east of the Jordan, from Reuben, Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh there: 120,000 armed with every kind of weapon of war.
- **1 Chronicles 12:38**
All these men of war, arrayed for battle, came to Hebron fully determined to make David king over all Israel. And all the rest of the Israelites were of one mind to make David king.
- **1 Chronicles 12:39**
They spent three days there eating and drinking with David, for their relatives had provided for them.
- **1 Chronicles 12:40**
And their neighbors from as far away as Issachar, Zebulun, and Naphtali came bringing food on donkeys, camels, mules, and oxen—abundant supplies of flour, fig cakes and raisin cakes, wine and oil, oxen and sheep. Indeed, there was joy in Israel.
- **1 Chronicles 13:1**
Then David conferred with all his leaders, the commanders of hundreds and of thousands.
- **1 Chronicles 13:2**
And he said to the whole assembly of Israel, “If it seems good to you, and if this is of the LORD our God, let us send word far and wide to the rest of our brothers in all the land of Israel, and also to the priests and Levites in their cities and pasturelands, so that they may join us.
- **1 Chronicles 13:3**
Then let us bring back the ark of our God, for we did not inquire of Him in the days of Saul.”
- **1 Chronicles 13:4**
And because this proposal seemed right to all the people, the whole assembly agreed to it.
- **1 Chronicles 13:5**
So David assembled all Israel, from the River Shihor in Egypt to Lebo-hamath, to bring the ark of God from Kiriath-jearim.
- **1 Chronicles 13:6**
David and all Israel went up to Baalah of Judah (that is, Kiriath-jearim) to bring up from there the ark of God the LORD, who is enthroned between the cherubim—the ark that is called by the Name.
- **1 Chronicles 13:7**
So they carried the ark of God from the house of Abinadab on a new cart, with Uzzah and Ahio guiding the cart.
- **1 Chronicles 13:8**
David and all the Israelites were celebrating before God with all their might, with songs and on harps and lyres, with tambourines, cymbals, and trumpets.
- **1 Chronicles 13:9**
When they came to the threshing floor of Chidon, Uzzah reached out and took hold of the ark, because the oxen had stumbled.
- **1 Chronicles 13:10**
And the anger of the LORD burned against Uzzah, and He struck him down because he had put his hand on the ark. So he died there before God.
- **1 Chronicles 13:11**
Then David became angry because the LORD had burst forth against Uzzah; so he named that place Perez-uzzah, as it is called to this day.
- **1 Chronicles 13:12**
That day David feared God and asked, “How can I ever bring the ark of God to me?”
- **1 Chronicles 13:13**
So he did not move the ark with him to the City of David; instead, he took it aside to the house of Obed-edom the Gittite.
- **1 Chronicles 13:14**
Thus the ark of God remained with the family of Obed-edom in his house for three months, and the LORD blessed his household and everything he owned.
- **1 Chronicles 14:1**
Now Hiram king of Tyre sent envoys to David, along with cedar logs, stonemasons, and carpenters, to build a palace for him.
- **1 Chronicles 14:2**
And David realized that the LORD had established him as king over Israel and had highly exalted his kingdom for the sake of His people Israel.
- **1 Chronicles 14:3**
And David took more wives in Jerusalem and became the father of more sons and daughters.
- **1 Chronicles 14:4**
These are the names of the children born to him in Jerusalem: Shammua, Shobab, Nathan, Solomon,
- **1 Chronicles 14:5**
Ibhar, Elishua, Elpelet,
- **1 Chronicles 14:6**
Nogah, Nepheg, Japhia,
- **1 Chronicles 14:7**
Elishama, Beeliada, and Eliphelet.
- **1 Chronicles 14:8**
When the Philistines heard that David had been anointed king over all Israel, they all went in search of him; but David learned of this and went out to face them.
- **1 Chronicles 14:9**
Now the Philistines had come and raided the Valley of Rephaim.
- **1 Chronicles 14:10**
So David inquired of God, “Should I go up against the Philistines? Will You deliver them into my hand?” “Go,” replied the LORD, “for I will deliver them into your hand.”
- **1 Chronicles 14:11**
So David and his men went up to Baal-perazim, where he defeated the Philistines and said, “Like a bursting flood, God has burst out against my enemies by my hand.” So they called that place Baal-perazim.
- **1 Chronicles 14:12**
There the Philistines abandoned their gods, and David ordered that they be burned in the fire.
- **1 Chronicles 14:13**
Once again the Philistines raided the valley.
- **1 Chronicles 14:14**
So David again inquired of God, who answered him, “Do not march up after them, but circle around them and attack them in front of the balsam trees.
- **1 Chronicles 14:15**
As soon as you hear the sound of marching in the tops of the balsam trees, move out to battle, because this will mean that God has marched out before you to strike the camp of the Philistines.”
- **1 Chronicles 14:16**
So David did as God had commanded him, and they struck down the army of the Philistines all the way from Gibeon to Gezer.
- **1 Chronicles 14:17**
And David’s fame went out into every land, and the LORD caused all nations to fear him.
- **1 Chronicles 15:1**
David constructed buildings for himself in the City of David, and he prepared a place for the ark of God and pitched a tent for it.
- **1 Chronicles 15:2**
Then David said, “No one but the Levites may carry the ark of God, because the LORD has chosen them to carry the ark of the LORD and to minister before Him forever.”
- **1 Chronicles 15:3**
And David assembled all Israel in Jerusalem to bring up the ark of the LORD to the place he had prepared for it.
- **1 Chronicles 15:4**
Then he gathered together the descendants of Aaron and the Levites:
- **1 Chronicles 15:5**
From the Kohathites, Uriel the chief and 120 of his relatives;
- **1 Chronicles 15:6**
from the Merarites, Asaiah the chief and 220 of his relatives;
- **1 Chronicles 15:7**
from the Gershomites, Joel the chief and 130 of his relatives;
- **1 Chronicles 15:8**
from the Elizaphanites, Shemaiah the chief and 200 of his relatives;
- **1 Chronicles 15:9**
from the Hebronites, Eliel the chief and 80 of his relatives;
- **1 Chronicles 15:10**
and from the Uzzielites, Amminadab the chief and 112 of his relatives.
- **1 Chronicles 15:11**
David summoned the priests Zadok and Abiathar and the Levites Uriel, Asaiah, Joel, Shemaiah, Eliel, and Amminadab.
- **1 Chronicles 15:12**
And he said to them, “You are the heads of the Levitical families. You and your relatives must consecrate yourselves so that you may bring the ark of the LORD, the God of Israel, to the place I have prepared for it.
- **1 Chronicles 15:13**
It was because you Levites were not with us the first time that the LORD our God burst forth in anger against us. For we did not consult Him about the proper order.”
- **1 Chronicles 15:14**
So the priests and Levites consecrated themselves to bring up the ark of the LORD, the God of Israel.
- **1 Chronicles 15:15**
And the Levites carried the ark of God on their shoulders with the poles, as Moses had commanded in accordance with the word of the LORD.
- **1 Chronicles 15:16**
David also told the leaders of the Levites to appoint their relatives as singers to lift up their voices with joy, accompanied by musical instruments—harps, lyres, and cymbals.
- **1 Chronicles 15:17**
So the Levites appointed Heman son of Joel; from his brothers, Asaph son of Berechiah; from their brothers the Merarites, Ethan son of Kushaiah;
- **1 Chronicles 15:18**
and with them their brothers next in rank: Zechariah, Jaaziel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Unni, Eliab, Benaiah, Maaseiah, Mattithiah, Eliphelehu, Mikneiah, and the gatekeepers Obed-edom and Jeiel.
- **1 Chronicles 15:19**
The musicians Heman, Asaph, and Ethan were to sound the bronze cymbals.
- **1 Chronicles 15:20**
Zechariah, Aziel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Unni, Eliab, Maaseiah, and Benaiah were to play the harps according to Alamoth.
- **1 Chronicles 15:21**
And Mattithiah, Eliphelehu, Mikneiah, Obed-edom, Jeiel, and Azaziah were to lead the music with lyres according to Sheminith.
- **1 Chronicles 15:22**
Chenaniah the head Levite was the director of the music because he was highly skilled.
- **1 Chronicles 15:23**
Berechiah and Elkanah were to be guardians of the ark.
- **1 Chronicles 15:24**
Shebaniah, Joshaphat, Nethanel, Amasai, Zechariah, Benaiah, and Eliezer—the priests—were to blow the trumpets before the ark of God. Obed-edom and Jehiah were also to be guardians of the ark.
- **1 Chronicles 15:25**
So David, the elders of Israel, and the commanders of thousands went with rejoicing to bring the ark of the covenant of the LORD from the house of Obed-edom.
- **1 Chronicles 15:26**
And because God helped the Levites who were carrying the ark of the covenant of the LORD, they sacrificed seven bulls and seven rams.
- **1 Chronicles 15:27**
Now David was dressed in a robe of fine linen, as were all the Levites who were carrying the ark, as well as the singers and Chenaniah, the director of music for the singers. David also wore a linen ephod.
- **1 Chronicles 15:28**
So all Israel brought up the ark of the covenant of the LORD with shouting, with the sounding of rams’ horns and trumpets, and with cymbals and the music of harps and lyres.
- **1 Chronicles 15:29**
As the ark of the covenant of the LORD was entering the City of David, Saul’s daughter Michal looked down from a window and saw King David dancing and celebrating, and she despised him in her heart.
- **1 Chronicles 16:1**
So they brought the ark of God and placed it inside the tent that David had pitched for it. And they presented burnt offerings and peace offerings before God.
- **1 Chronicles 16:2**
When David had finished sacrificing the burnt offerings and peace offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the LORD.
- **1 Chronicles 16:3**
Then he distributed to every man and woman of Israel a loaf of bread, a date cake, and a raisin cake.
- **1 Chronicles 16:4**
David appointed some of the Levites to minister before the ark of the LORD, to celebrate, to give thanks, and to praise the LORD, the God of Israel.
- **1 Chronicles 16:5**
Asaph was the chief, Zechariah was second, then Jeiel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Mattithiah, Eliab, Benaiah, Obed-edom, and Jeiel. They were to play the harps and lyres, while Asaph sounded the cymbals
- **1 Chronicles 16:6**
and the priests Benaiah and Jahaziel blew the trumpets regularly before the ark of the covenant of God.
- **1 Chronicles 16:7**
On that day David first committed to Asaph and his brothers this song of thanksgiving to the LORD:
- **1 Chronicles 16:8**
“Give thanks to the LORD; call upon His name; make known His deeds among the nations.
- **1 Chronicles 16:9**
Sing to Him, sing praises to Him; tell of all His wonders.
- **1 Chronicles 16:10**
Glory in His holy name; let the hearts of those who seek the LORD rejoice.
- **1 Chronicles 16:11**
Seek out the LORD and His strength; seek His face always.
- **1 Chronicles 16:12**
Remember the wonders He has done, His marvels, and the judgments He has pronounced,
- **1 Chronicles 16:13**
O offspring of His servant Israel, O sons of Jacob, His chosen ones.
- **1 Chronicles 16:14**
He is the LORD our God; His judgments carry throughout the earth.
- **1 Chronicles 16:15**
Remember His covenant forever, the word He ordained for a thousand generations—
- **1 Chronicles 16:16**
the covenant He made with Abraham, and the oath He swore to Isaac.
- **1 Chronicles 16:17**
He confirmed it to Jacob as a decree, to Israel as an everlasting covenant:
- **1 Chronicles 16:18**
‘I will give you the land of Canaan as the portion of your inheritance.’
- **1 Chronicles 16:19**
When they were few in number, few indeed, and strangers in the land,
- **1 Chronicles 16:20**
they wandered from nation to nation, from one kingdom to another.
- **1 Chronicles 16:21**
He let no man oppress them; He rebuked kings on their behalf:
- **1 Chronicles 16:22**
‘Do not touch My anointed ones! Do no harm to My prophets!’
- **1 Chronicles 16:23**
Sing to the LORD, all the earth. Proclaim His salvation day after day.
- **1 Chronicles 16:24**
Declare His glory among the nations, His wonderful deeds among all peoples.
- **1 Chronicles 16:25**
For great is the LORD, and greatly to be praised; He is to be feared above all gods.
- **1 Chronicles 16:26**
For all the gods of the nations are idols, but it is the LORD who made the heavens.
- **1 Chronicles 16:27**
Splendor and majesty are before Him; strength and joy fill His dwelling.
- **1 Chronicles 16:28**
Ascribe to the LORD, O families of the nations, ascribe to the LORD glory and strength.
- **1 Chronicles 16:29**
Ascribe to the LORD the glory due His name; bring an offering and come before Him. Worship the LORD in the splendor of His holiness;
- **1 Chronicles 16:30**
tremble before Him, all the earth. The world is firmly established; it cannot be moved.
- **1 Chronicles 16:31**
Let the heavens be glad, and the earth rejoice. Let them say among the nations, ‘The LORD reigns!’
- **1 Chronicles 16:32**
Let the sea resound, and all that fills it; let the fields exult, and all that is in them.
- **1 Chronicles 16:33**
Then the trees of the forest will sing for joy before the LORD, for He is coming to judge the earth.
- **1 Chronicles 16:34**
Give thanks to the LORD, for He is good; His loving devotion endures forever.
- **1 Chronicles 16:35**
Then cry out: ‘Save us, O God of our salvation; gather and deliver us from the nations, that we may give thanks to Your holy name, that we may glory in Your praise.’
- **1 Chronicles 16:36**
Blessed be the LORD, the God of Israel, from everlasting to everlasting.” Then all the people said, “Amen!” and “Praise the LORD!”
- **1 Chronicles 16:37**
So David left Asaph and his brothers there before the ark of the covenant of the LORD, to minister there regularly according to the daily requirements,
- **1 Chronicles 16:38**
along with Obed-edom and his sixty-eight relatives. Obed-edom son of Jeduthun, and also Hosah, were to be gatekeepers.
- **1 Chronicles 16:39**
And David left Zadok the priest and his fellow priests before the tabernacle of the LORD at the high place in Gibeon
- **1 Chronicles 16:40**
to regularly present burnt offerings to the LORD on the altar of burnt offerings, morning and evening, according to all that was written in the Law of the LORD, which He had commanded Israel to keep.
- **1 Chronicles 16:41**
With them were Heman, Jeduthun, and the rest of those chosen and designated by name to give thanks to the LORD, for “His loving devotion endures forever.”
- **1 Chronicles 16:42**
Heman and Jeduthun had with them trumpets and cymbals for the music and instruments for the songs of God. And the sons of Jeduthun were stationed at the gate.
- **1 Chronicles 16:43**
Then all the people departed for their homes, and David returned home to bless his household.
- **1 Chronicles 17:1**
After David had settled into his palace, he said to Nathan the prophet, “Here I am, living in a house of cedar, while the ark of the covenant of the LORD is under a tent.”
- **1 Chronicles 17:2**
And Nathan replied to David, “Do all that is in your heart, for God is with you.”
- **1 Chronicles 17:3**
But that night the word of God came to Nathan, saying,
- **1 Chronicles 17:4**
“Go and tell My servant David that this is what the LORD says: You are not the one to build Me a house in which to dwell.
- **1 Chronicles 17:5**
For I have not dwelt in a house from the day I brought Israel up out of Egypt until this day, but I have moved from tent to tent and dwelling to dwelling.
- **1 Chronicles 17:6**
In all My journeys with all the Israelites, have I ever asked any of the leaders I appointed to shepherd My people, ‘Why haven’t you built Me a house of cedar?’
- **1 Chronicles 17:7**
Now then, you are to tell My servant David that this is what the LORD of Hosts says: I took you from the pasture, from following the flock, to be the ruler over My people Israel.
- **1 Chronicles 17:8**
I have been with you wherever you have gone, and I have cut off all your enemies from before you. Now I will make for you a name like the greatest in the land.
- **1 Chronicles 17:9**
And I will provide a place for My people Israel and will plant them so that they may dwell in a place of their own and be disturbed no more. No longer will the sons of wickedness oppress them as they did at the beginning
- **1 Chronicles 17:10**
and have done since the day I appointed judges over My people Israel. And I will subdue all your enemies. Moreover, I declare to you that the LORD will build a house for you.
- **1 Chronicles 17:11**
And when your days are fulfilled and you go to be with your fathers, I will raise up your descendant after you, one of your own sons, and I will establish his kingdom.
- **1 Chronicles 17:12**
He will build a house for Me, and I will establish his throne forever.
- **1 Chronicles 17:13**
I will be his Father, and he will be My son. And I will never remove My loving devotion from him as I removed it from your predecessor.
- **1 Chronicles 17:14**
But I will set him over My house and My kingdom forever, and his throne will be established forever.”
- **1 Chronicles 17:15**
So Nathan relayed to David all the words of this entire vision.
- **1 Chronicles 17:16**
Then King David went in, sat before the LORD, and said, “Who am I, O LORD God, and what is my house, that You have brought me this far?
- **1 Chronicles 17:17**
And as if this was a small thing in Your eyes, O God, You have spoken about the future of the house of Your servant and have regarded me as a man of great distinction, O LORD God.
- **1 Chronicles 17:18**
What more can David say to You for so honoring Your servant? For You know Your servant,
- **1 Chronicles 17:19**
O LORD. For the sake of Your servant and according to Your own heart, You have accomplished this great thing and revealed all Your greatness.
- **1 Chronicles 17:20**
O LORD, there is none like You, and there is no God but You, according to everything we have heard with our own ears.
- **1 Chronicles 17:21**
And who is like Your people Israel—the one nation on earth whom God went out to redeem as a people for Himself? You made a name for Yourself through great and awesome wonders by driving out nations from before Your people, whom You redeemed from Egypt.
- **1 Chronicles 17:22**
For You have made Your people Israel Your very own forever, and You, O LORD, have become their God.
- **1 Chronicles 17:23**
And now, O LORD, let the word You have spoken concerning Your servant and his house be established forever. Do as You have promised,
- **1 Chronicles 17:24**
so that Your name will be established and magnified forever when it is said, ‘The LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel, is God over Israel.’ And may the house of Your servant David be established before You.
- **1 Chronicles 17:25**
For You, my God, have revealed to Your servant that You will build a house for him. Therefore Your servant has found the courage to pray before You.
- **1 Chronicles 17:26**
And now, O LORD, You are God! And You have promised this goodness to Your servant.
- **1 Chronicles 17:27**
So now You have been pleased to bless the house of Your servant, that it may continue forever before You. For You, O LORD, have blessed it, and it will be blessed forever.”
- **1 Chronicles 18:1**
Some time later, David defeated the Philistines, subdued them, and took Gath and its villages from the hand of the Philistines.
- **1 Chronicles 18:2**
David also defeated the Moabites, and they became subject to David and brought him tribute.
- **1 Chronicles 18:3**
As far as Hamath, David also defeated King Hadadezer of Zobah, who had marched out to establish his dominion along the Euphrates River.
- **1 Chronicles 18:4**
David captured from him a thousand chariots, seven thousand charioteers, and twenty thousand foot soldiers, and he hamstrung all the horses except a hundred he kept for the chariots.
- **1 Chronicles 18:5**
When the Arameans of Damascus came to help King Hadadezer of Zobah, David struck down twenty-two thousand men.
- **1 Chronicles 18:6**
Then he placed garrisons in Aram of Damascus, and the Arameans became subject to David and brought him tribute. So the LORD made David victorious wherever he went.
- **1 Chronicles 18:7**
And David took the gold shields that belonged to the officers of Hadadezer and brought them to Jerusalem.
- **1 Chronicles 18:8**
And from Tibhath and Cun, cities of Hadadezer, David took a large amount of bronze, with which Solomon made the bronze Sea, the pillars, and various bronze articles.
- **1 Chronicles 18:9**
When King Tou of Hamath heard that David had defeated the entire army of Hadadezer king of Zobah,
- **1 Chronicles 18:10**
he sent his son Hadoram to greet King David and bless him for fighting and defeating Hadadezer, who had been at war with Tou. Hadoram brought all kinds of articles of gold and silver and bronze,
- **1 Chronicles 18:11**
and King David dedicated these to the LORD, along with the silver and gold he had carried off from all these nations—from Edom and Moab, and from the Ammonites, Philistines, and Amalekites.
- **1 Chronicles 18:12**
Moreover, Abishai son of Zeruiah struck down eighteen thousand Edomites in the Valley of Salt.
- **1 Chronicles 18:13**
He placed garrisons in Edom, and all the Edomites were subject to David. So the LORD made David victorious wherever he went.
- **1 Chronicles 18:14**
Thus David reigned over all Israel and administered justice and righteousness for all his people:
- **1 Chronicles 18:15**
Joab son of Zeruiah was over the army; Jehoshaphat son of Ahilud was the recorder;
- **1 Chronicles 18:16**
Zadok son of Ahitub and Ahimelech son of Abiathar were priests; Shavsha was the scribe;
- **1 Chronicles 18:17**
Benaiah son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and Pelethites; and David’s sons were chief officials at the king’s side.
- **1 Chronicles 19:1**
Some time later, Nahash king of the Ammonites died and was succeeded by his son.
- **1 Chronicles 19:2**
And David said, “I will show kindness to Hanun son of Nahash, because his father showed kindness to me.” So David sent messengers to console Hanun concerning his father. But when David’s servants arrived in the land of the Ammonites to console him,
- **1 Chronicles 19:3**
the princes of the Ammonites said to Hanun, “Just because David has sent you comforters, do you really believe he is showing respect for your father? Have not his servants come to you to explore the land, spy it out, and overthrow it?”
- **1 Chronicles 19:4**
So Hanun took David’s servants, shaved their beards, cut off their garments at the hips, and sent them away.
- **1 Chronicles 19:5**
When someone came and told David about his men, he sent messengers to meet them, since the men had been thoroughly humiliated. The king told them, “Stay in Jericho until your beards have grown back, and then return.”
- **1 Chronicles 19:6**
When the Ammonites realized that they had become a stench to David, Hanun and the Ammonites sent a thousand talents of silver to hire for themselves chariots and horsemen from Aram-naharaim, Aram-maacah, and Zobah.
- **1 Chronicles 19:7**
So they hired for themselves thirty-two thousand chariots, as well as the king of Maacah with his troops, who came and camped near Medeba while the Ammonites came from their cities and marched out for battle.
- **1 Chronicles 19:8**
On hearing this, David sent Joab and the entire army of mighty men.
- **1 Chronicles 19:9**
The Ammonites marched out and arrayed themselves for battle at the entrance to the city, while the kings who had come stayed by themselves in the open country.
- **1 Chronicles 19:10**
When Joab saw the battle lines before him and behind him, he selected some of the best men of Israel and arrayed them against the Arameans.
- **1 Chronicles 19:11**
And he placed the rest of the forces under the command of his brother Abishai, who arrayed them against the Ammonites.
- **1 Chronicles 19:12**
“If the Arameans are too strong for me,” said Joab, “then you will come to my rescue. And if the Ammonites are too strong for you, then I will come to your rescue.
- **1 Chronicles 19:13**
Be strong and let us fight bravely for our people and for the cities of our God. May the LORD do what is good in His sight.”
- **1 Chronicles 19:14**
So Joab and his troops advanced to fight the Arameans, who fled before him.
- **1 Chronicles 19:15**
When the Ammonites saw that the Arameans had fled, they too fled before Joab’s brother Abishai, and they entered the city. So Joab went back to Jerusalem.
- **1 Chronicles 19:16**
When the Arameans saw that they had been defeated by Israel, they sent messengers to bring more Arameans from beyond the Euphrates, with Shophach the commander of Hadadezer’s army leading them.
- **1 Chronicles 19:17**
When this was reported to David, he gathered all Israel, crossed the Jordan, advanced toward the Arameans, and arrayed for battle against them. When David lined up to engage them in battle, they fought against him.
- **1 Chronicles 19:18**
But the Arameans fled before Israel, and David killed seven thousand of their charioteers and forty thousand foot soldiers. He also killed Shophach the commander of their army.
- **1 Chronicles 19:19**
When Hadadezer’s subjects saw that they had been defeated by Israel, they made peace with David and became subject to him. So the Arameans were unwilling to help the Ammonites anymore.
- **1 Chronicles 20:1**
In the spring, at the time when kings march out to war, Joab led out the army and ravaged the land of the Ammonites. He came to Rabbah and besieged it, but David remained in Jerusalem. And Joab attacked Rabbah and demolished it.
- **1 Chronicles 20:2**
Then David took the crown from the head of their king. It was found to weigh a talent of gold and was set with precious stones, and it was placed on David’s head. And David took a great amount of plunder from the city.
- **1 Chronicles 20:3**
David brought out the people who were there and put them to work with saws, iron picks, and axes. And he did the same to all the Ammonite cities. Then David and all his troops returned to Jerusalem.
- **1 Chronicles 20:4**
Some time later, war broke out with the Philistines at Gezer. At that time Sibbecai the Hushathite killed Sippai, a descendant of the Rephaim, and the Philistines were subdued.
- **1 Chronicles 20:5**
Once again there was a battle with the Philistines, and Elhanan son of Jair killed Lahmi the brother of Goliath the Gittite, the shaft of whose spear was like a weaver’s beam.
- **1 Chronicles 20:6**
And there was still another battle at Gath, where there was a man of great stature with six fingers on each hand and six toes on each foot—twenty-four in all. He too was descended from Rapha,
- **1 Chronicles 20:7**
and when he taunted Israel, Jonathan the son of David’s brother Shimei killed him.
- **1 Chronicles 20:8**
So these descendants of Rapha in Gath fell at the hands of David and his servants.
- **1 Chronicles 21:1**
Then Satan rose up against Israel and incited David to take a census of Israel.
- **1 Chronicles 21:2**
So David said to Joab and the commanders of the troops, “Go and count the Israelites from Beersheba to Dan and bring me a report, so that I may know their number.”
- **1 Chronicles 21:3**
But Joab replied, “May the LORD multiply His troops a hundred times over. My lord the king, are they not all servants of my lord? Why does my lord want to do this? Why should he bring guilt on Israel?”
- **1 Chronicles 21:4**
Nevertheless, the king’s word prevailed against Joab. So Joab departed and traveled throughout Israel, and then he returned to Jerusalem.
- **1 Chronicles 21:5**
And Joab reported to David the total number of the troops. In all Israel there were 1,100,000 men who drew the sword, including 470,000 in Judah.
- **1 Chronicles 21:6**
But Joab did not include Levi and Benjamin in the count, because the king’s command was detestable to him.
- **1 Chronicles 21:7**
This command was also evil in the sight of God; so He struck Israel.
- **1 Chronicles 21:8**
Then David said to God, “I have sinned greatly because I have done this thing. Now I beg You to take away the iniquity of Your servant, for I have acted very foolishly.”
- **1 Chronicles 21:9**
And the LORD instructed Gad, David’s seer,
- **1 Chronicles 21:10**
“Go and tell David that this is what the LORD says: ‘I am offering you three options. Choose one of them, and I will carry it out against you.’”
- **1 Chronicles 21:11**
So Gad went and said to David, “This is what the LORD says: ‘You must choose
- **1 Chronicles 21:12**
between three years of famine, three months of being swept away before your enemies and overtaken by their swords, or three days of the sword of the LORD—days of plague upon the land, with the angel of the LORD ravaging every part of Israel.’ Now then, decide how I should reply to Him who sent me.”
- **1 Chronicles 21:13**
David answered Gad, “I am deeply distressed. Please, let me fall into the hand of the LORD, for His mercies are very great; but do not let me fall into the hands of men.”
- **1 Chronicles 21:14**
So the LORD sent a plague upon Israel, and seventy thousand men of Israel fell dead.
- **1 Chronicles 21:15**
Then God sent an angel to destroy Jerusalem, but as the angel was doing so, the LORD saw it and relented from the calamity, and He said to the angel who was destroying the people, “Enough! Withdraw your hand now!” At that time the angel of the LORD was standing by the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite.
- **1 Chronicles 21:16**
When David lifted up his eyes and saw the angel of the LORD standing between heaven and earth, with a drawn sword in his hand stretched out over Jerusalem, David and the elders, clothed in sackcloth, fell facedown.
- **1 Chronicles 21:17**
And David said to God, “Was it not I who gave the order to count the people? I am the one who has sinned and acted wickedly. But these sheep, what have they done? O LORD my God, please let Your hand fall upon me and my father’s house, but do not let this plague remain upon Your people.”
- **1 Chronicles 21:18**
Then the angel of the LORD ordered Gad to tell David to go up and build an altar to the LORD on the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite.
- **1 Chronicles 21:19**
So David went up at the word that Gad had spoken in the name of the LORD.
- **1 Chronicles 21:20**
Now Ornan was threshing wheat when he turned and saw the angel; and his four sons who were with him hid themselves.
- **1 Chronicles 21:21**
David came to Ornan, and when Ornan looked out and saw David, he left the threshing floor and bowed facedown before David.
- **1 Chronicles 21:22**
Then David said to Ornan, “Grant me the site of this threshing floor, that I may build an altar to the LORD. Sell it to me for the full price, so that the plague upon the people may be halted.”
- **1 Chronicles 21:23**
Ornan said to David, “My lord the king may take whatever seems good. Look, I will give the oxen for the burnt offerings, the threshing sledges for the wood, and the wheat for the grain offering—I will give it all.”
- **1 Chronicles 21:24**
“No,” replied King David, “I insist on paying the full price, for I will not take for the LORD what belongs to you, nor will I offer burnt offerings that cost me nothing.”
- **1 Chronicles 21:25**
So David paid Ornan six hundred shekels of gold for the site.
- **1 Chronicles 21:26**
And there he built an altar to the LORD and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings. He called upon the LORD, who answered him with fire from heaven on the altar of burnt offering.
- **1 Chronicles 21:27**
Then the LORD spoke to the angel, who put his sword back into its sheath.
- **1 Chronicles 21:28**
At that time, when David saw that the LORD had answered him at the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite, he offered sacrifices there.
- **1 Chronicles 21:29**
For the tabernacle of the LORD that Moses had made in the wilderness and the altar of burnt offering were presently at the high place in Gibeon,
- **1 Chronicles 21:30**
but David could not go before it to inquire of God, because he was afraid of the sword of the angel of the LORD.
- **1 Chronicles 22:1**
Then David said, “Here shall be the house of the LORD God, as well as the altar of burnt offering for Israel.”
- **1 Chronicles 22:2**
So David gave orders to gather the foreigners in the land of Israel, from whom he appointed stonecutters to prepare finished stones for building the house of God.
- **1 Chronicles 22:3**
David provided a large quantity of iron to make the nails for the doors of the gateways and for the fittings, together with more bronze than could be weighed
- **1 Chronicles 22:4**
and more cedar logs than could be counted; for the Sidonians and Tyrians had brought a large quantity of cedar logs to David.
- **1 Chronicles 22:5**
And David said, “My son Solomon is young and inexperienced, and the house to be built for the LORD must be exceedingly magnificent—famous and glorious throughout all lands. Therefore I must make preparations for it.” So David made lavish preparations before his death.
- **1 Chronicles 22:6**
Then David called for his son Solomon and instructed him to build a house for the LORD, the God of Israel.
- **1 Chronicles 22:7**
“My son,” said David to Solomon, “it was in my heart to build a house for the Name of the LORD my God,
- **1 Chronicles 22:8**
but this word of the LORD came to me: ‘You have shed much blood and waged great wars. You are not to build a house for My Name because you have shed so much blood on the ground before Me.
- **1 Chronicles 22:9**
But a son will be born to you who will be a man of rest. I will give him rest from all his enemies on every side; for his name will be Solomon, and I will grant to Israel peace and quiet during his reign.
- **1 Chronicles 22:10**
He is the one who will build a house for My Name. He will be My son, and I will be his Father. And I will establish the throne of his kingdom over Israel forever.’
- **1 Chronicles 22:11**
Now, my son, may the LORD be with you, and may you succeed in building the house of the LORD your God, as He said you would.
- **1 Chronicles 22:12**
Above all, may the LORD give you insight and understanding when He puts you in command over Israel, so that you may keep the Law of the LORD your God.
- **1 Chronicles 22:13**
Then you will succeed, if you carefully follow the statutes and ordinances that the LORD commanded Moses for Israel. Be strong and courageous. Do not be afraid or discouraged.
- **1 Chronicles 22:14**
Now behold, I have taken great pains to provide for the house of the LORD—100,000 talents of gold, 1,000,000 talents of silver, and bronze and iron too great to be weighed. I have also provided timber and stone, and you may add to them.
- **1 Chronicles 22:15**
You also have many workers: stonecutters, masons, carpenters, and men skilled in every kind of work—
- **1 Chronicles 22:16**
in gold and silver, bronze and iron—craftsmen beyond number. Now begin the work, and may the LORD be with you.”
- **1 Chronicles 22:17**
Then David ordered all the leaders of Israel to help his son Solomon:
- **1 Chronicles 22:18**
“Is not the LORD your God with you, and has He not granted you rest on every side? For He has given the inhabitants of the land into my hand, and the land has been subdued before the LORD and His people.
- **1 Chronicles 22:19**
Now set your heart and soul to seek the LORD your God. Get started building the sanctuary of the LORD God, so that you may bring the ark of the covenant of the LORD and the holy articles of God into the temple that will be built for the Name of the LORD.”
- **1 Chronicles 23:1**
When David was old and full of years, he installed his son Solomon as king over Israel.
- **1 Chronicles 23:2**
Then he gathered all the leaders of Israel, as well as the priests and Levites.
- **1 Chronicles 23:3**
The Levites thirty years of age or older were counted, and the total number of men was 38,000.
- **1 Chronicles 23:4**
“Of these,” said David, “24,000 are to oversee the work of the house of the LORD, 6,000 are to be officers and judges,
- **1 Chronicles 23:5**
4,000 are to be gatekeepers, and 4,000 are to praise the LORD with the instruments I have made for giving praise.”
- **1 Chronicles 23:6**
Then David divided the Levites into divisions according to the sons of Levi: Gershom, Kohath, and Merari.
- **1 Chronicles 23:7**
The Gershonites: Ladan and Shimei.
- **1 Chronicles 23:8**
The sons of Ladan: Jehiel the first, Zetham, and Joel—three in all.
- **1 Chronicles 23:9**
The sons of Shimei: Shelomoth, Haziel, and Haran—three in all. These were the heads of the families of Ladan.
- **1 Chronicles 23:10**
And the sons of Shimei: Jahath, Zina, Jeush, and Beriah. These were the sons of Shimei—four in all.
- **1 Chronicles 23:11**
Jahath was the first and Zizah was the second; but Jeush and Beriah did not have many sons, so they were counted as one family and received a single assignment.
- **1 Chronicles 23:12**
The sons of Kohath: Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel—four in all.
- **1 Chronicles 23:13**
The sons of Amram: Aaron and Moses. Aaron and his descendants were set apart forever to consecrate the most holy things, to burn incense before the LORD, to minister before Him, and to pronounce blessings in His name forever.
- **1 Chronicles 23:14**
As for Moses the man of God, his sons were named among the tribe of Levi.
- **1 Chronicles 23:15**
The sons of Moses: Gershom and Eliezer.
- **1 Chronicles 23:16**
The descendants of Gershom: Shebuel was the first.
- **1 Chronicles 23:17**
The descendants of Eliezer: Rehabiah was the first. Eliezer did not have any other sons, but the sons of Rehabiah were very numerous.
- **1 Chronicles 23:18**
The sons of Izhar: Shelomith was the first.
- **1 Chronicles 23:19**
The sons of Hebron: Jeriah was the first, Amariah the second, Jahaziel the third, and Jekameam the fourth.
- **1 Chronicles 23:20**
The sons of Uzziel: Micah was the first and Isshiah the second.
- **1 Chronicles 23:21**
The sons of Merari: Mahli and Mushi. The sons of Mahli: Eleazar and Kish.
- **1 Chronicles 23:22**
Eleazar died without having any sons; he had only daughters. Their cousins, the sons of Kish, married them.
- **1 Chronicles 23:23**
The sons of Mushi: Mahli, Eder, and Jeremoth—three in all.
- **1 Chronicles 23:24**
These were the descendants of Levi by their families—the heads of families, registered individually by name—those twenty years of age or older who worked in the service of the house of the LORD.
- **1 Chronicles 23:25**
For David had said, “The LORD, the God of Israel, has given rest to His people and has come to dwell in Jerusalem forever.
- **1 Chronicles 23:26**
So now the Levites no longer need to carry the tabernacle or any of the articles for its service.”
- **1 Chronicles 23:27**
For according to the final instructions of David, the Levites twenty years of age or older were counted,
- **1 Chronicles 23:28**
but their duty was to assist the descendants of Aaron with the service of the house of the LORD, being responsible for the courts and chambers, the purification of all the holy things, and the work of the service of the house of God,
- **1 Chronicles 23:29**
as well as for the rows of the showbread, the fine flour for the grain offering, the wafers of unleavened bread, the baking, the mixing, and all measurements of quantity and size.
- **1 Chronicles 23:30**
They were also to stand every morning to give thanks and praise to the LORD, and likewise in the evening.
- **1 Chronicles 23:31**
Whenever burnt offerings were presented to the LORD on the Sabbaths, New Moons, and appointed feasts, they were to serve regularly before the LORD in the numbers prescribed for them.
- **1 Chronicles 23:32**
So the Levites were to carry out the responsibilities for the Tent of Meeting and the Holy Place, and, under their brothers the descendants of Aaron, the service of the house of the LORD.
- **1 Chronicles 24:1**
These were the divisions of the descendants of Aaron. The sons of Aaron were Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.
- **1 Chronicles 24:2**
But Nadab and Abihu died before their father did, and they had no sons; so Eleazar and Ithamar served as priests.
- **1 Chronicles 24:3**
With the help of Eleazar’s descendant Zadok and Ithamar’s descendant Ahimelech, David divided them according to the offices of their service.
- **1 Chronicles 24:4**
Since more leaders were found among Eleazar’s descendants than those of Ithamar, they were divided accordingly. There were sixteen heads of families from the descendants of Eleazar and eight from the descendants of Ithamar.
- **1 Chronicles 24:5**
Thus they were divided by lot, for there were officers of the sanctuary and officers of God among both Eleazar’s and Ithamar’s descendants.
- **1 Chronicles 24:6**
The scribe, Shemaiah son of Nethanel, a Levite, recorded their names in the presence of the king and of the officers: Zadok the priest, Ahimelech son of Abiathar, and the heads of families of the priests and the Levites—one family being taken from Eleazar, and then one from Ithamar.
- **1 Chronicles 24:7**
The first lot fell to Jehoiarib, the second to Jedaiah,
- **1 Chronicles 24:8**
the third to Harim, the fourth to Seorim,
- **1 Chronicles 24:9**
the fifth to Malchijah, the sixth to Mijamin,
- **1 Chronicles 24:10**
the seventh to Hakkoz, the eighth to Abijah,
- **1 Chronicles 24:11**
the ninth to Jeshua, the tenth to Shecaniah,
- **1 Chronicles 24:12**
the eleventh to Eliashib, the twelfth to Jakim,
- **1 Chronicles 24:13**
the thirteenth to Huppah, the fourteenth to Jeshebeab,
- **1 Chronicles 24:14**
the fifteenth to Bilgah, the sixteenth to Immer,
- **1 Chronicles 24:15**
the seventeenth to Hezir, the eighteenth to Happizzez,
- **1 Chronicles 24:16**
the nineteenth to Pethahiah, the twentieth to Jehezkel,
- **1 Chronicles 24:17**
the twenty-first to Jachin, the twenty-second to Gamul,
- **1 Chronicles 24:18**
the twenty-third to Delaiah, and the twenty-fourth to Maaziah.
- **1 Chronicles 24:19**
This was their appointed order for service when they entered the house of the LORD, according to the regulations prescribed for them by their forefather Aaron, as the LORD, the God of Israel, had commanded him.
- **1 Chronicles 24:20**
Now these were the remaining descendants of Levi: From the sons of Amram: Shubael; from the sons of Shubael: Jehdeiah.
- **1 Chronicles 24:21**
As for Rehabiah, from his sons: The first was Isshiah.
- **1 Chronicles 24:22**
From the Izharites: Shelomoth; from the sons of Shelomoth: Jahath.
- **1 Chronicles 24:23**
From the sons of Hebron: Jeriah was the first, Amariah the second, Jahaziel the third, and Jekameam the fourth.
- **1 Chronicles 24:24**
From the sons of Uzziel: Micah; from the sons of Micah: Shamir.
- **1 Chronicles 24:25**
The brother of Micah: Isshiah; from the sons of Isshiah: Zechariah.
- **1 Chronicles 24:26**
The sons of Merari: Mahli and Mushi. The son of Jaaziah: Beno.
- **1 Chronicles 24:27**
The descendants of Merari from Jaaziah: Beno, Shoham, Zaccur, and Ibri.
- **1 Chronicles 24:28**
From Mahli: Eleazar, who had no sons.
- **1 Chronicles 24:29**
From Kish: Jerahmeel the son of Kish.
- **1 Chronicles 24:30**

but God said to me, ‘You are not to build a house for My Name, because you are a man of war who has spilled blood.’
- **1 Chronicles 28:4**
Yet the LORD, the God of Israel, chose me out of all my father’s house to be king over Israel forever. For He chose Judah as leader, and from the house of Judah He chose my father’s household, and from my father’s sons He was pleased to make me king over all Israel.

- **1 Chronicles 28:9**
As for you, Solomon my son, know the God of your father and serve Him wholeheartedly and with a willing mind, for the LORD searches every heart and understands the intent of every thought. If you seek Him, He will be found by you; but if you forsake Him, He will reject you forever.

- **1 Chronicles 29:3**

- **1 Chronicles 29:4**
three thousand talents of gold (the gold of Ophir) and seven thousand talents of refined silver, to overlay the walls of the buildings,
- **1 Chronicles 29:5**
for the gold work and the silver work, and for all the work to be done by the craftsmen. Now who will volunteer to consecrate himself to the LORD today?”
- **1 Chronicles 29:6**
Then the leaders of the households, the officers of the tribes of Israel, the commanders of thousands and of hundreds, and the officials in charge of the king’s work gave willingly.
- **1 Chronicles 29:7**
Toward the service of God’s house they gave 5,000 talents and 10,000 darics of gold, 10,000 talents of silver, 18,000 talents of bronze, and 100,000 talents of iron.
- **1 Chronicles 29:8**
Whoever had precious stones gave them to the treasury of the house of the LORD, under the care of Jehiel the Gershonite.
- **1 Chronicles 29:9**
And the people rejoiced at the willing response of their leaders, for they had given to the LORD freely and wholeheartedly. And King David also rejoiced greatly.
- **1 Chronicles 29:10**
Then David blessed the LORD in the sight of all the assembly and said: “May You be blessed, O LORD, God of our father Israel, from everlasting to everlasting.
- **1 Chronicles 29:11**
Yours, O LORD, is the greatness and the power and the glory and the splendor and the majesty, for everything in heaven and on earth belongs to You. Yours, O LORD, is the kingdom, and You are exalted as head over all.
- **1 Chronicles 29:12**
Both riches and honor come from You, and You are the ruler over all. In Your hands are power and might to exalt and give strength to all.
- **1 Chronicles 29:13**
Now therefore, our God, we give You thanks, and we praise Your glorious name.
- **1 Chronicles 29:14**
But who am I, and who are my people, that we should be able to give as generously as this? For everything comes from You, and from Your own hand we have given to You.
- **1 Chronicles 29:15**
For we are foreigners and strangers in Your presence, as were all our forefathers. Our days on earth are like a shadow, without hope.
- **1 Chronicles 29:16**
O LORD our God, from Your hand comes all this abundance that we have provided to build You a house for Your holy Name, and all of it belongs to You.
- **1 Chronicles 29:17**
I know, my God, that You test the heart and delight in uprightness. All these things I have given willingly and with an upright heart, and now I have seen Your people who are present here giving joyfully and willingly to You.
- **1 Chronicles 29:18**
O LORD, God of our fathers Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, keep this desire forever in the intentions of the hearts of Your people, and direct their hearts toward You.
- **1 Chronicles 29:19**
And give my son Solomon a whole heart to keep and carry out all Your commandments, decrees, and statutes, and to build Your palace for which I have made provision.”
- **1 Chronicles 29:20**
Then David said to the whole assembly, “Blessed be the LORD your God.” So the whole assembly blessed the LORD, the God of their fathers. They bowed down and paid homage to the LORD and to the king.
- **1 Chronicles 29:21**
The next day they offered sacrifices and presented burnt offerings to the LORD: a thousand bulls, a thousand rams, and a thousand lambs, along with their drink offerings, and other sacrifices in abundance for all Israel.
- **1 Chronicles 29:22**
That day they ate and drank with great joy in the presence of the LORD. Then, for a second time, they designated David’s son Solomon as king, anointing him before the LORD as ruler, and Zadok as the priest.
- **1 Chronicles 29:23**
So Solomon sat on the throne of the LORD as king in place of his father David. He prospered, and all Israel obeyed him.
- **1 Chronicles 29:24**
All the officials and mighty men, as well as all of King David’s sons, pledged their allegiance to King Solomon.
- **1 Chronicles 29:25**
The LORD highly exalted Solomon in the sight of all Israel and bestowed on him royal majesty such as had not been bestowed on any king in Israel before him.

He died at a ripe old age, full of years, riches, and honor, and his son Solomon reigned in his place.
- **1 Chronicles 29:29**

- **1 Chronicles 29:30**
together with all the details of his reign, his might, and the circumstances that came upon him and Israel and all the kingdoms of the lands.
