title:: Holy Bible/Luke

- **Luke 1:1**
Many have undertaken to compose an account of the things that have been fulfilled among us,
- **Luke 1:2**
just as they were handed down to us by the initial eyewitnesses and servants of the word.
- **Luke 1:3**
Therefore, having carefully investigated everything from the beginning, it seemed good also to me to write an orderly account for you, most excellent Theophilus,
- **Luke 1:4**
so that you may know the certainty of the things you have been taught.
- **Luke 1:5**
In the time of Herod king of Judea there was a priest named Zechariah, who belonged to the priestly division of Abijah, and whose wife Elizabeth was a daughter of Aaron.
- **Luke 1:6**
Both of them were righteous in the sight of God, walking blamelessly in all the commandments and decrees of the Lord.
- **Luke 1:7**
But they had no children, because Elizabeth was barren, and they were both well along in years.
- **Luke 1:8**
One day while Zechariah’s division was on duty and he was serving as priest before God,
- **Luke 1:9**
he was chosen by lot, according to the custom of the priesthood, to enter the temple of the Lord and burn incense.
- **Luke 1:10**
And at the hour of the incense offering, the whole congregation was praying outside.
- **Luke 1:11**
Just then an angel of the Lord appeared to Zechariah, standing at the right side of the altar of incense.
- **Luke 1:12**
When Zechariah saw him, he was startled and gripped with fear.
- **Luke 1:13**
But the angel said to him, “Do not be afraid, Zechariah, because your prayer has been heard. Your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son, and you are to give him the name John.
- **Luke 1:14**
He will be a joy and delight to you, and many will rejoice at his birth,
- **Luke 1:15**
for he will be great in the sight of the Lord. He shall never take wine or strong drink, and he will be filled with the Holy Spirit even from his mother’s womb.
- **Luke 1:16**
Many of the sons of Israel he will turn back to the Lord their God.
- **Luke 1:17**
And he will go on before the Lord in the spirit and power of Elijah, to turn the hearts of the fathers to their children and the disobedient to the wisdom of the righteous—to make ready a people prepared for the Lord.”
- **Luke 1:18**
“How can I be sure of this?” Zechariah asked the angel. “I am an old man, and my wife is well along in years.”
- **Luke 1:19**
“I am Gabriel,” replied the angel. “I stand in the presence of God, and I have been sent to speak to you and to bring you this good news.
- **Luke 1:20**
And now you will be silent and unable to speak until the day this comes to pass, because you did not believe my words, which will be fulfilled at their proper time.”
- **Luke 1:21**
Meanwhile, the people were waiting for Zechariah and wondering why he took so long in the temple.
- **Luke 1:22**
When he came out and was unable to speak to them, they realized he had seen a vision in the temple. He kept making signs to them but remained speechless.
- **Luke 1:23**
And when the days of his service were complete, he returned home.
- **Luke 1:24**
After these days, his wife Elizabeth became pregnant and for five months remained in seclusion. She declared,
- **Luke 1:25**
“The Lord has done this for me. In these days He has shown me favor and taken away my disgrace among the people.”
- **Luke 1:26**
In the sixth month, God sent the angel Gabriel to a town in Galilee called Nazareth,
- **Luke 1:27**
to a virgin pledged in marriage to a man named Joseph, who was of the house of David. And the virgin’s name was Mary.
- **Luke 1:28**
The angel appeared to her and said, “Greetings, you who are highly favored! The Lord is with you.”
- **Luke 1:29**
Mary was greatly troubled at his words and wondered what kind of greeting this might be.
- **Luke 1:30**
So the angel told her, “Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found favor with God.
- **Luke 1:31**
Behold, you will conceive and give birth to a son, and you are to give Him the name Jesus.
- **Luke 1:32**
He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High. The Lord God will give Him the throne of His father David,
- **Luke 1:33**
and He will reign over the house of Jacob forever. His kingdom will never end!”
- **Luke 1:34**
“How can this be,” Mary asked the angel, “since I am a virgin?”
- **Luke 1:35**
The angel replied, “The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you. So the Holy One to be born will be called the Son of God.
- **Luke 1:36**
Look, even Elizabeth your relative has conceived a son in her old age, and she who was called barren is in her sixth month.
- **Luke 1:37**
For no word from God will ever fail.”
- **Luke 1:38**
“I am the Lord’s servant,” Mary answered. “May it happen to me according to your word.” Then the angel left her.
- **Luke 1:39**
In those days Mary got ready and hurried to a town in the hill country of Judah,
- **Luke 1:40**
where she entered the home of Zechariah and greeted Elizabeth.
- **Luke 1:41**
When Elizabeth heard Mary’s greeting, the baby leaped in her womb, and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit.
- **Luke 1:42**
In a loud voice she exclaimed, “Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb!
- **Luke 1:43**
And why am I so honored, that the mother of my Lord should come to me?
- **Luke 1:44**
For as soon as the sound of your greeting reached my ears, the baby in my womb leaped for joy.
- **Luke 1:45**
Blessed is she who has believed that the Lord’s word to her will be fulfilled.”
- **Luke 1:46**
Then Mary said: “My soul magnifies the Lord,
- **Luke 1:47**
and my spirit rejoices in God my Savior!
- **Luke 1:48**
For He has looked with favor on the humble state of His servant. From now on all generations will call me blessed.
- **Luke 1:49**
For the Mighty One has done great things for me. Holy is His name.
- **Luke 1:50**
His mercy extends to those who fear Him, from generation to generation.
- **Luke 1:51**
He has performed mighty deeds with His arm; He has scattered those who are proud in the thoughts of their hearts.
- **Luke 1:52**
He has brought down rulers from their thrones, but has exalted the humble.
- **Luke 1:53**
He has filled the hungry with good things, but has sent the rich away empty.
- **Luke 1:54**
He has helped His servant Israel, remembering to be merciful,
- **Luke 1:55**
as He promised to our fathers, to Abraham and his descendants forever.”
- **Luke 1:56**
Mary stayed with Elizabeth for about three months and then returned home.
- **Luke 1:57**
When the time came for Elizabeth to have her child, she gave birth to a son.
- **Luke 1:58**
Her neighbors and relatives heard that the Lord had shown her great mercy, and they rejoiced with her.
- **Luke 1:59**
On the eighth day, when they came to circumcise the child, they were going to name him after his father Zechariah.
- **Luke 1:60**
But his mother replied, “No! He shall be called John.”
- **Luke 1:61**
They said to her, “There is no one among your relatives who bears this name.”
- **Luke 1:62**
So they made signs to his father to find out what he wanted to name the child.
- **Luke 1:63**
Zechariah asked for a tablet and wrote, “His name is John.” And they were all amazed.
- **Luke 1:64**
Immediately Zechariah’s mouth was opened and his tongue was released, and he began to speak, praising God.
- **Luke 1:65**
All their neighbors were filled with awe, and people throughout the hill country of Judea were talking about these events.
- **Luke 1:66**
And all who heard this wondered in their hearts and asked, “What then will this child become?” For the Lord’s hand was with him.
- **Luke 1:67**
Then his father Zechariah was filled with the Holy Spirit and prophesied:
- **Luke 1:68**
“Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel, because He has visited and redeemed His people.
- **Luke 1:69**
He has raised up a horn of salvation for us in the house of His servant David,
- **Luke 1:70**
as He spoke through His holy prophets, those of ages past,
- **Luke 1:71**
salvation from our enemies and from the hand of all who hate us,
- **Luke 1:72**
to show mercy to our fathers and to remember His holy covenant,
- **Luke 1:73**
the oath He swore to our father Abraham, to grant us
- **Luke 1:74**
deliverance from hostile hands, that we may serve Him without fear,
- **Luke 1:75**
in holiness and righteousness before Him all the days of our lives.
- **Luke 1:76**
And you, child, will be called a prophet of the Most High; for you will go on before the Lord to prepare the way for Him,
- **Luke 1:77**
to give to His people the knowledge of salvation through the forgiveness of their sins,
- **Luke 1:78**
because of the tender mercy of our God, by which the Dawn will visit us from on high,
- **Luke 1:79**
to shine on those who live in darkness and in the shadow of death, to guide our feet into the path of peace.”
- **Luke 1:80**
And the child grew and became strong in spirit; and he lived in the wilderness until the time of his public appearance to Israel.
- **Luke 2:1**
Now in those days a decree went out from Caesar Augustus that a census should be taken of the whole empire.
- **Luke 2:2**
This was the first census to take place while Quirinius was governor of Syria.
- **Luke 2:3**
And everyone went to his own town to register.
- **Luke 2:4**
So Joseph also went up from Nazareth in Galilee to Judea, to the city of David called Bethlehem, since he was from the house and line of David.
- **Luke 2:5**
He went there to register with Mary, who was pledged to him in marriage and was expecting a child.
- **Luke 2:6**
While they were there, the time came for her Child to be born.
- **Luke 2:7**
And she gave birth to her firstborn, a Son. She wrapped Him in swaddling cloths and laid Him in a manger, because there was no room for them in the inn.
- **Luke 2:8**
And there were shepherds residing in the fields nearby, keeping watch over their flocks by night.
- **Luke 2:9**
Just then an angel of the Lord stood before them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were terrified.
- **Luke 2:10**
But the angel said to them, “Do not be afraid! For behold, I bring you good news of great joy that will be for all the people:
- **Luke 2:11**
Today in the city of David a Savior has been born to you. He is Christ the Lord!
- **Luke 2:12**
And this will be a sign to you: You will find a baby wrapped in swaddling cloths and lying in a manger.”
- **Luke 2:13**
And suddenly there appeared with the angel a great multitude of the heavenly host, praising God and saying:
- **Luke 2:14**
“Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace to men on whom His favor rests!”
- **Luke 2:15**
When the angels had left them and gone into heaven, the shepherds said to one another, “Let us go to Bethlehem and see this thing that has happened, which the Lord has made known to us.”
- **Luke 2:16**
So they hurried off and found Mary and Joseph and the Baby, who was lying in the manger.
- **Luke 2:17**
After they had seen the Child, they spread the message they had received about Him.
- **Luke 2:18**
And all who heard it were amazed at what the shepherds said to them.
- **Luke 2:19**
But Mary treasured up all these things and pondered them in her heart.
- **Luke 2:20**
The shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all they had heard and seen, which was just as the angel had told them.
- **Luke 2:21**
When the eight days until His circumcision had passed, He was named Jesus, the name the angel had given Him before He had been conceived.
- **Luke 2:22**
And when the time of purification according to the Law of Moses was complete, His parents brought Him to Jerusalem to present Him to the Lord
- **Luke 2:23**
(as it is written in the Law of the Lord: “Every firstborn male shall be consecrated to the Lord”),
- **Luke 2:24**
and to offer the sacrifice specified in the Law of the Lord: “A pair of turtledoves or two young pigeons.”
- **Luke 2:25**
Now there was a man in Jerusalem named Simeon, who was righteous and devout. He was waiting for the consolation of Israel, and the Holy Spirit was upon him.
- **Luke 2:26**
The Holy Spirit had revealed to him that he would not see death before he had seen the Lord’s Christ.
- **Luke 2:27**
Led by the Spirit, he went into the temple courts. And when the parents brought in the child Jesus to do for Him what was customary under the Law,
- **Luke 2:28**
Simeon took Him in his arms and blessed God, saying:
- **Luke 2:29**
“Sovereign Lord, as You have promised, You now dismiss Your servant in peace.
- **Luke 2:30**
For my eyes have seen Your salvation,
- **Luke 2:31**
which You have prepared in the sight of all people,
- **Luke 2:32**
a light for revelation to the Gentiles, and for glory to Your people Israel.”
- **Luke 2:33**
The Child’s father and mother were amazed at what was spoken about Him.
- **Luke 2:34**
Then Simeon blessed them and said to His mother Mary: “Behold, this Child is appointed to cause the rise and fall of many in Israel, and to be a sign that will be spoken against,
- **Luke 2:35**
so that the thoughts of many hearts will be revealed—and a sword will pierce your soul as well.”
- **Luke 2:36**
There was also a prophetess named Anna, the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Asher, who was well along in years. She had been married for seven years,
- **Luke 2:37**
and then was a widow to the age of eighty-four. She never left the temple, but worshiped night and day, fasting and praying.
- **Luke 2:38**
Coming forward at that moment, she gave thanks to God and spoke about the Child to all who were waiting for the redemption of Jerusalem.
- **Luke 2:39**
When Jesus’ parents had done everything required by the Law of the Lord, they returned to Galilee, to their own town of Nazareth.
- **Luke 2:40**
And the Child grew and became strong. He was filled with wisdom, and the grace of God was upon Him.
- **Luke 2:41**
Every year His parents went to Jerusalem for the Feast of the Passover.
- **Luke 2:42**
And when He was twelve years old, they went up according to the custom of the Feast.
- **Luke 2:43**
When those days were over and they were returning home, the boy Jesus remained behind in Jerusalem, but His parents were unaware He had stayed.
- **Luke 2:44**
Assuming He was in their company, they traveled on for a day before they began to look for Him among their relatives and friends.
- **Luke 2:45**
When they could not find Him, they returned to Jerusalem to search for Him.
- **Luke 2:46**
Finally, after three days they found Him in the temple courts, sitting among the teachers, listening to them and asking them questions.
- **Luke 2:47**
And all who heard Him were astounded at His understanding and His answers.
- **Luke 2:48**
When His parents saw Him, they were astonished. “Child, why have You done this to us?” His mother asked. “Your father and I have been anxiously searching for You.”
- **Luke 2:49**
“Why were you looking for Me?” He asked. “Did you not know that I had to be in My Father’s house?”
- **Luke 2:50**
But they did not understand the statement He was making to them.
- **Luke 2:51**
Then He went down to Nazareth with them and was obedient to them. But His mother treasured up all these things in her heart.
- **Luke 2:52**
And Jesus grew in wisdom and stature, and in favor with God and man.
- **Luke 3:1**
In the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar, while Pontius Pilate was governor of Judea, Herod tetrarch of Galilee, his brother Philip tetrarch of Ituraea and Trachonitis, and Lysanias tetrarch of Abilene,
- **Luke 3:2**
during the high priesthood of Annas and Caiaphas, the word of God came to John son of Zechariah in the wilderness.
- **Luke 3:3**
He went into all the region around the Jordan, preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins,
- **Luke 3:4**
as it is written in the book of the words of Isaiah the prophet: “A voice of one calling in the wilderness, ‘Prepare the way for the Lord, make straight paths for Him.
- **Luke 3:5**
Every valley shall be filled in, and every mountain and hill made low. The crooked ways shall be made straight, and the rough ways smooth.
- **Luke 3:6**
And all humanity will see God’s salvation.’”
- **Luke 3:7**
Then John said to the crowds coming out to be baptized by him, “You brood of vipers, who warned you to flee from the coming wrath?
- **Luke 3:8**
Produce fruit, then, in keeping with repentance. And do not begin to say to yourselves, ‘We have Abraham as our father.’ For I tell you that out of these stones God can raise up children for Abraham.
- **Luke 3:9**
The axe lies ready at the root of the trees, and every tree that does not produce good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire.”
- **Luke 3:10**
The crowds asked him, “What then should we do?”
- **Luke 3:11**
John replied, “Whoever has two tunics should share with him who has none, and whoever has food should do the same.”
- **Luke 3:12**
Even tax collectors came to be baptized. “Teacher,” they asked, “what should we do?”
- **Luke 3:13**
“Collect no more than you are authorized,” he answered.
- **Luke 3:14**
Then some soldiers asked him, “And what should we do?” “Do not take money by force or false accusation,” he said. “Be content with your wages.”
- **Luke 3:15**
The people were waiting expectantly and were all wondering in their hearts if John could be the Christ.
- **Luke 3:16**
John answered all of them: “I baptize you with water, but One more powerful than I will come, the straps of whose sandals I am not worthy to untie. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire.
- **Luke 3:17**
His winnowing fork is in His hand to clear His threshing floor and to gather the wheat into His barn; but He will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire.”
- **Luke 3:18**
With these and many other exhortations, John proclaimed the good news to the people.
- **Luke 3:19**
But when he rebuked Herod the tetrarch regarding his brother’s wife Herodias and all the evils he had done,
- **Luke 3:20**
Herod added this to them all: He locked John up in prison.
- **Luke 3:21**
When all the people were being baptized, Jesus was baptized too. And as He was praying, heaven was opened,
- **Luke 3:22**
and the Holy Spirit descended on Him in a bodily form like a dove. And a voice came from heaven: “You are My beloved Son; in You I am well pleased.”
- **Luke 3:23**
Jesus Himself was about thirty years old when He began His ministry. He was regarded as the son of Joseph, the son of Heli,
- **Luke 3:24**
the son of Matthat, the son of Levi, the son of Melchi, the son of Jannai, the son of Joseph,
- **Luke 3:25**
the son of Mattathias, the son of Amos, the son of Nahum, the son of Esli, the son of Naggai,
- **Luke 3:26**
the son of Maath, the son of Mattathias, the son of Semein, the son of Josech, the son of Joda,
- **Luke 3:27**
the son of Joanan, the son of Rhesa, the son of Zerubbabel, the son of Shealtiel, the son of Neri,
- **Luke 3:28**
the son of Melchi, the son of Addi, the son of Cosam, the son of Elmadam, the son of Er,
- **Luke 3:29**
the son of Joshua, the son of Eliezer, the son of Jorim, the son of Matthat, the son of Levi,
- **Luke 3:30**
the son of Simeon, the son of Judah, the son of Joseph, the son of Jonam, the son of Eliakim,
- **Luke 3:31**
the son of Melea, the son of Menna, the son of Mattatha, the son of Nathan, the son of David,
- **Luke 3:32**
the son of Jesse, the son of Obed, the son of Boaz, the son of Sala, the son of Nahshon,
- **Luke 3:33**
the son of Amminadab, the son of Admin, the son of Arni, the son of Hezron, the son of Perez, the son of Judah,
- **Luke 3:34**
the son of Jacob, the son of Isaac, the son of Abraham, the son of Terah, the son of Nahor,
- **Luke 3:35**
the son of Serug, the son of Reu, the son of Peleg, the son of Eber, the son of Shelah,
- **Luke 3:36**
the son of Cainan, the son of Arphaxad, the son of Shem, the son of Noah, the son of Lamech,
- **Luke 3:37**
the son of Methuselah, the son of Enoch, the son of Jared, the son of Mahalalel, the son of Cainan,
- **Luke 3:38**
the son of Enosh, the son of Seth, the son of Adam, the son of God.
- **Luke 4:1**
Then Jesus, full of the Holy Spirit, returned from the Jordan and was led by the Spirit into the wilderness,
- **Luke 4:2**
where for forty days He was tempted by the devil. He ate nothing during those days, and when they had ended, He was hungry.
- **Luke 4:3**
The devil said to Him, “If You are the Son of God, tell this stone to become bread.”
- **Luke 4:4**
But Jesus answered, “It is written: ‘Man shall not live on bread alone.’”
- **Luke 4:5**
Then the devil led Him up to a high place and showed Him in an instant all the kingdoms of the world.
- **Luke 4:6**
“I will give You authority over all these kingdoms and all their glory,” he said. “For it has been relinquished to me, and I can give it to anyone I wish.
- **Luke 4:7**
So if You worship me, it will all be Yours.”
- **Luke 4:8**
But Jesus answered, “It is written: ‘Worship the Lord your God and serve Him only.’”
- **Luke 4:9**
Then the devil led Him to Jerusalem and set Him on the pinnacle of the temple. “If You are the Son of God,” he said, “throw Yourself down from here.
- **Luke 4:10**
For it is written: ‘He will command His angels concerning You to guard You carefully;
- **Luke 4:11**
and they will lift You up in their hands, so that You will not strike Your foot against a stone.’”
- **Luke 4:12**
But Jesus answered, “It also says, ‘Do not put the Lord your God to the test.’”
- **Luke 4:13**
When the devil had finished every temptation, he left Him until an opportune time.
- **Luke 4:14**
Jesus returned to Galilee in the power of the Spirit, and the news about Him spread throughout the surrounding region.
- **Luke 4:15**
He taught in their synagogues and was glorified by everyone.
- **Luke 4:16**
Then Jesus came to Nazareth, where He had been brought up. As was His custom, He entered the synagogue on the Sabbath. And when He stood up to read,
- **Luke 4:17**
the scroll of the prophet Isaiah was handed to Him. Unrolling it, He found the place where it was written:
- **Luke 4:18**
“The Spirit of the Lord is on Me, because He has anointed Me to preach good news to the poor. He has sent Me to proclaim liberty to the captives and recovery of sight to the blind, to release the oppressed,
- **Luke 4:19**
to proclaim the year of the Lord’s favor.”
- **Luke 4:20**
Then He rolled up the scroll, returned it to the attendant, and sat down. The eyes of everyone in the synagogue were fixed on Him,
- **Luke 4:21**
and He began by saying, “Today this Scripture is fulfilled in your hearing.”
- **Luke 4:22**
All spoke well of Him and marveled at the gracious words that came from His lips. “Isn’t this the son of Joseph?” they asked.
- **Luke 4:23**
Jesus said to them, “Surely you will quote this proverb to Me: ‘Physician, heal yourself! Do here in Your hometown what we have heard that You did in Capernaum.’”
- **Luke 4:24**
Then He added, “Truly I tell you, no prophet is accepted in his hometown.
- **Luke 4:25**
But I tell you truthfully that there were many widows in Israel in the time of Elijah, when the sky was shut for three and a half years and great famine swept over all the land.
- **Luke 4:26**
Yet Elijah was not sent to any of them, but to the widow of Zarephath in Sidon.
- **Luke 4:27**
And there were many lepers in Israel in the time of Elisha the prophet. Yet not one of them was cleansed—only Naaman the Syrian.”
- **Luke 4:28**
On hearing this, all the people in the synagogue were enraged.
- **Luke 4:29**
They got up, drove Him out of the town, and led Him to the brow of the hill on which the town was built, in order to throw Him over the cliff.
- **Luke 4:30**
But Jesus passed through the crowd and went on His way.
- **Luke 4:31**
Then He went down to Capernaum, a town in Galilee, and on the Sabbath He began to teach the people.
- **Luke 4:32**
They were astonished at His teaching, because His message had authority.
- **Luke 4:33**
In the synagogue there was a man possessed by the spirit of an unclean demon. He cried out in a loud voice,
- **Luke 4:34**
“Ha! What do You want with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have You come to destroy us? I know who You are—the Holy One of God!”
- **Luke 4:35**
But Jesus rebuked the demon. “Be silent!” He said. “Come out of him!” At this, the demon threw the man down before them all and came out without harming him.
- **Luke 4:36**
All the people were overcome with amazement and asked one another, “What is this message? With authority and power He commands the unclean spirits, and they come out!”
- **Luke 4:37**
And the news about Jesus spread throughout the surrounding region.
- **Luke 4:38**
After Jesus had left the synagogue, He went to the home of Simon, whose mother-in-law was suffering from a high fever. So they appealed to Jesus on her behalf,
- **Luke 4:39**
and He stood over her and rebuked the fever, and it left her. And she got up at once and began to serve them.
- **Luke 4:40**
At sunset, all who were ill with various diseases were brought to Jesus, and laying His hands on each one, He healed them.
- **Luke 4:41**
Demons also came out of many people, shouting, “You are the Son of God!” But He rebuked the demons and would not allow them to speak, because they knew He was the Christ.
- **Luke 4:42**
At daybreak, Jesus went out to a solitary place, and the crowds were looking for Him. They came to Him and tried to keep Him from leaving.
- **Luke 4:43**
But Jesus told them, “I must preach the good news of the kingdom of God to the other towns as well, because that is why I was sent.”
- **Luke 4:44**
And He continued to preach in the synagogues of Judea.
- **Luke 5:1**
On one occasion, while Jesus was standing by the Lake of Gennesaret with the crowd pressing in on Him to hear the word of God,
- **Luke 5:2**
He saw two boats at the edge of the lake. The fishermen had left them and were washing their nets.
- **Luke 5:3**
Jesus got into the boat belonging to Simon and asked him to put out a little from shore. And sitting down, He taught the people from the boat.
- **Luke 5:4**
When Jesus had finished speaking, He said to Simon, “Put out into deep water and let down your nets for a catch.”
- **Luke 5:5**
“Master,” Simon replied, “we have worked hard all night without catching anything. But because You say so, I will let down the nets.”
- **Luke 5:6**
When they had done so, they caught such a large number of fish that their nets began to tear.
- **Luke 5:7**
So they signaled to their partners in the other boat to come and help them, and they came and filled both boats so full that they began to sink.
- **Luke 5:8**
When Simon Peter saw this, he fell at Jesus’ knees. “Go away from me, Lord,” he said, “for I am a sinful man.”
- **Luke 5:9**
For he and his companions were astonished at the catch of fish they had taken,
- **Luke 5:10**
and so were his partners James and John, the sons of Zebedee. “Do not be afraid,” Jesus said to Simon. “From now on you will catch men.”
- **Luke 5:11**
And when they had brought their boats ashore, they left everything and followed Him.
- **Luke 5:12**
While Jesus was in one of the towns, a man came along who was covered with leprosy. When he saw Jesus, he fell facedown and begged Him, “Lord, if You are willing, You can make me clean.”
- **Luke 5:13**
Jesus reached out His hand and touched the man. “I am willing,” He said. “Be clean!” And immediately the leprosy left him.
- **Luke 5:14**
“Do not tell anyone,” Jesus instructed him. “But go, show yourself to the priest and present the offering Moses prescribed for your cleansing, as a testimony to them.”
- **Luke 5:15**
But the news about Jesus spread all the more, and great crowds came to hear Him and to be healed of their sicknesses.
- **Luke 5:16**
Yet He frequently withdrew to the wilderness to pray.
- **Luke 5:17**
One day Jesus was teaching, and the Pharisees and teachers of the law were sitting there. People had come from Jerusalem and from every village of Galilee and Judea, and the power of the Lord was present for Him to heal the sick.
- **Luke 5:18**
Just then some men came carrying a paralyzed man on a mat. They tried to bring him inside to set him before Jesus,
- **Luke 5:19**
but they could not find a way through the crowd. So they went up on the roof and lowered him on his mat through the tiles into the middle of the crowd, right in front of Jesus.
- **Luke 5:20**
When Jesus saw their faith, He said, “Friend, your sins are forgiven.”
- **Luke 5:21**
But the scribes and Pharisees began thinking to themselves, “Who is this man who speaks blasphemy? Who can forgive sins but God alone?”
- **Luke 5:22**
Knowing what they were thinking, Jesus replied, “Why are you thinking these things in your hearts?
- **Luke 5:23**
Which is easier: to say, ‘Your sins are forgiven,’ or to say, ‘Get up and walk?’
- **Luke 5:24**
But so that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on the earth to forgive sins...” He said to the paralytic, “I tell you, get up, pick up your mat, and go home.”
- **Luke 5:25**
And immediately the man stood up before them, took what he had been lying on, and went home glorifying God.
- **Luke 5:26**
Everyone was taken with amazement and glorified God. They were filled with awe and said, “We have seen remarkable things today.”
- **Luke 5:27**
After this, Jesus went out and saw a tax collector named Levi sitting at the tax booth. “Follow Me,” He told him,
- **Luke 5:28**
and Levi got up, left everything, and followed Him.
- **Luke 5:29**
Then Levi hosted a great banquet for Jesus at his house. A large crowd of tax collectors was there, along with others who were eating with them.
- **Luke 5:30**
But the Pharisees and their scribes complained to Jesus’ disciples, “Why do you eat and drink with tax collectors and sinners?”
- **Luke 5:31**
Jesus answered, “It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick.
- **Luke 5:32**
I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners, to repentance.”
- **Luke 5:33**
Then they said to Him, “John’s disciples and those of the Pharisees frequently fast and pray, but Yours keep on eating and drinking.”
- **Luke 5:34**
Jesus replied, “Can you make the guests of the bridegroom fast while He is with them?
- **Luke 5:35**
But the time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them; then they will fast.”
- **Luke 5:36**
He also told them a parable: “No one tears a piece of cloth from a new garment and sews it on an old one. If he does, he will tear the new garment as well, and the patch from the new will not match the old.
- **Luke 5:37**
And no one pours new wine into old wineskins. If he does, the new wine will burst the skins, the wine will spill, and the wineskins will be ruined.
- **Luke 5:38**
Instead, new wine is poured into new wineskins.
- **Luke 5:39**
And no one after drinking old wine wants new, for he says, ‘The old is better.’”
- **Luke 6:1**
One Sabbath Jesus was passing through the grainfields, and His disciples began to pick the heads of grain, rub them in their hands, and eat them.
- **Luke 6:2**
But some of the Pharisees asked, “Why are you doing what is unlawful on the Sabbath?”
- **Luke 6:3**
Jesus replied, “Have you not read what David did when he and his companions were hungry?
- **Luke 6:4**
He entered the house of God, took the consecrated bread and gave it to his companions, and ate what is lawful only for the priests to eat.”
- **Luke 6:5**
Then Jesus declared, “The Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath.”
- **Luke 6:6**
On another Sabbath Jesus entered the synagogue and was teaching, and a man was there whose right hand was withered.
- **Luke 6:7**
Looking for a reason to accuse Jesus, the scribes and Pharisees were watching Him closely to see if He would heal on the Sabbath.
- **Luke 6:8**
But Jesus knew their thoughts and said to the man with the withered hand, “Get up and stand among us.” So he got up and stood there.
- **Luke 6:9**
Then Jesus said to them, “I ask you, which is lawful on the Sabbath: to do good or to do evil, to save life or to destroy it?”
- **Luke 6:10**
And after looking around at all of them, He said to the man, “Stretch out your hand.” He did so, and it was restored.
- **Luke 6:11**
But the scribes and Pharisees were filled with rage and began to discuss with one another what they might do to Jesus.
- **Luke 6:12**
In those days Jesus went out to the mountain to pray, and He spent the night in prayer to God.
- **Luke 6:13**
When daylight came, He called His disciples to Him and chose twelve of them, whom He also designated as apostles:
- **Luke 6:14**
Simon, whom He named Peter, and his brother Andrew; James and John; Philip and Bartholomew;
- **Luke 6:15**
Matthew and Thomas; James son of Alphaeus and Simon called the Zealot;
- **Luke 6:16**
Judas son of James, and Judas Iscariot, who became a traitor.
- **Luke 6:17**
Then Jesus came down with them and stood on a level place. A large crowd of His disciples was there, along with a great number of people from all over Judea, Jerusalem, and the sea coast of Tyre and Sidon.
- **Luke 6:18**
They had come to hear Him and to be healed of their diseases, and those troubled by unclean spirits were healed.
- **Luke 6:19**
The entire crowd was trying to touch Him, because power was coming from Him and healing them all.
- **Luke 6:20**
Looking up at His disciples, Jesus said: “Blessed are you who are poor, for yours is the kingdom of God.
- **Luke 6:21**
Blessed are you who hunger now, for you will be filled. Blessed are you who weep now, for you will laugh.
- **Luke 6:22**
Blessed are you when people hate you, and when they exclude you and insult you and reject your name as evil because of the Son of Man.
- **Luke 6:23**
Rejoice in that day and leap for joy, because great is your reward in heaven. For their fathers treated the prophets in the same way.
- **Luke 6:24**
But woe to you who are rich, for you have already received your comfort.
- **Luke 6:25**
Woe to you who are well fed now, for you will hunger. Woe to you who laugh now, for you will mourn and weep.
- **Luke 6:26**
Woe to you when all men speak well of you, for their fathers treated the false prophets in the same way.
- **Luke 6:27**
But to those of you who will listen, I say: Love your enemies, do good to those who hate you,
- **Luke 6:28**
bless those who curse you, pray for those who mistreat you.
- **Luke 6:29**
If someone strikes you on one cheek, turn to him the other also. And if someone takes your cloak, do not withhold your tunic as well.
- **Luke 6:30**
Give to everyone who asks you, and if anyone takes what is yours, do not demand it back.
- **Luke 6:31**
Do to others as you would have them do to you.
- **Luke 6:32**
If you love those who love you, what credit is that to you? Even sinners love those who love them.
- **Luke 6:33**
If you do good to those who do good to you, what credit is that to you? Even sinners do the same.
- **Luke 6:34**
And if you lend to those from whom you expect repayment, what credit is that to you? Even sinners lend to sinners, expecting to be repaid in full.
- **Luke 6:35**
But love your enemies, do good to them, and lend to them, expecting nothing in return. Then your reward will be great, and you will be sons of the Most High; for He is kind to the ungrateful and wicked.
- **Luke 6:36**
Be merciful, just as your Father is merciful.
- **Luke 6:37**
Do not judge, and you will not be judged. Do not condemn, and you will not be condemned. Forgive, and you will be forgiven.
- **Luke 6:38**
Give, and it will be given to you. A good measure, pressed down, shaken together, and running over will be poured into your lap. For with the measure you use, it will be measured back to you.”
- **Luke 6:39**
Jesus also told them a parable: “Can a blind man lead a blind man? Will they not both fall into a pit?
- **Luke 6:40**
A disciple is not above his teacher, but everyone who is fully trained will be like his teacher.
- **Luke 6:41**
Why do you look at the speck in your brother’s eye, but fail to notice the beam in your own eye?
- **Luke 6:42**
How can you say, ‘Brother, let me take the speck out of your eye,’ while you yourself fail to see the beam in your own eye? You hypocrite! First take the beam out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brother’s eye.
- **Luke 6:43**
No good tree bears bad fruit, nor does a bad tree bear good fruit.
- **Luke 6:44**
For each tree is known by its own fruit. Indeed, figs are not gathered from thornbushes, nor grapes from brambles.
- **Luke 6:45**
The good man brings good things out of the good treasure of his heart, and the evil man brings evil things out of the evil treasure of his heart. For out of the overflow of the heart, the mouth speaks.
- **Luke 6:46**
Why do you call Me ‘Lord, Lord,’ but not do what I say?
- **Luke 6:47**
I will show you what he is like who comes to Me and hears My words and acts on them:
- **Luke 6:48**
He is like a man building a house, who dug down deep and laid his foundation on the rock. When the flood came, the torrent crashed against that house but could not shake it, because it was well built.
- **Luke 6:49**
But the one who hears My words and does not act on them is like a man who built his house on ground without a foundation. The torrent crashed against that house, and immediately it fell—and great was its destruction!”
- **Luke 7:1**
When Jesus had concluded His discourse in the hearing of the people, He went to Capernaum.
- **Luke 7:2**
There a highly valued servant of a centurion was sick and about to die.
- **Luke 7:3**
When the centurion heard about Jesus, he sent some Jewish elders to ask Him to come and heal his servant.
- **Luke 7:4**
They came to Jesus and pleaded with Him earnestly, “This man is worthy to have You grant this,
- **Luke 7:5**
for he loves our nation and has built our synagogue.”
- **Luke 7:6**
So Jesus went with them. But when He was not far from the house, the centurion sent friends with the message: “Lord, do not trouble Yourself, for I am not worthy to have You come under my roof.
- **Luke 7:7**
That is why I did not consider myself worthy to come to You. But just say the word, and my servant will be healed.
- **Luke 7:8**
For I myself am a man under authority, with soldiers under me. I tell one to go, and he goes; and another to come, and he comes. I tell my servant to do something, and he does it.”
- **Luke 7:9**
When Jesus heard this, He marveled at the centurion. Turning to the crowd following Him, He said, “I tell you, not even in Israel have I found such great faith.”
- **Luke 7:10**
And when the messengers returned to the house, they found the servant in good health.
- **Luke 7:11**
Soon afterward, Jesus went to a town called Nain. His disciples went with Him, accompanied by a large crowd.
- **Luke 7:12**
As He approached the town gate, He saw a dead man being carried out, the only son of his mother, and she was a widow. And a large crowd from the town was with her.
- **Luke 7:13**
When the Lord saw her, He had compassion on her and said, “Do not weep.”
- **Luke 7:14**
Then He went up and touched the coffin, and those carrying it stood still. “Young man,” He said, “I tell you, get up!”
- **Luke 7:15**
And the dead man sat up and began to speak! Then Jesus gave him back to his mother.
- **Luke 7:16**
A sense of awe swept over all of them, and they glorified God. “A great prophet has appeared among us!” they said. “God has visited His people!”
- **Luke 7:17**
And the news about Jesus spread throughout Judea and all the surrounding region.
- **Luke 7:18**
Then John’s disciples informed him about all these things.
- **Luke 7:19**
So John called two of his disciples and sent them to ask the Lord, “Are You the One who was to come, or should we look for someone else?”
- **Luke 7:20**
When the men came to Jesus, they said, “John the Baptist sent us to ask, ‘Are You the One who was to come, or should we look for someone else?’”
- **Luke 7:21**
At that very hour Jesus healed many people of their diseases, afflictions, and evil spirits, and He gave sight to many who were blind.
- **Luke 7:22**
So He replied, “Go back and report to John what you have seen and heard: The blind receive sight, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, and the good news is preached to the poor.
- **Luke 7:23**
Blessed is the one who does not fall away on account of Me.”
- **Luke 7:24**
After John’s messengers had left, Jesus began to speak to the crowds about John: “What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed swaying in the wind?
- **Luke 7:25**
Otherwise, what did you go out to see? A man dressed in fine clothes? Look, those who wear elegant clothing and live in luxury are found in palaces.
- **Luke 7:26**
What then did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and more than a prophet.
- **Luke 7:27**
This is the one about whom it is written: ‘Behold, I will send My messenger ahead of You, who will prepare Your way before You.’
- **Luke 7:28**
I tell you, among those born of women there is no one greater than John, yet even the least in the kingdom of God is greater than he.”
- **Luke 7:29**
All the people who heard this, even the tax collectors, acknowledged God’s justice. For they had received the baptism of John.
- **Luke 7:30**
But the Pharisees and experts in the law rejected God’s purpose for themselves, because they had not been baptized by John.
- **Luke 7:31**
“To what, then, can I compare the men of this generation? What are they like?
- **Luke 7:32**
They are like children sitting in the marketplace and calling out to one another: ‘We played the flute for you, and you did not dance; we sang a dirge, and you did not weep.’
- **Luke 7:33**
For John the Baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking wine, and you say, ‘He has a demon!’
- **Luke 7:34**
The Son of Man came eating and drinking, and you say, ‘Look at this glutton and drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners!’
- **Luke 7:35**
But wisdom is vindicated by all her children.”
- **Luke 7:36**
Then one of the Pharisees invited Jesus to eat with him, and He entered the Pharisee’s house and reclined at the table.
- **Luke 7:37**
When a sinful woman from that town learned that Jesus was dining there, she brought an alabaster jar of perfume.
- **Luke 7:38**
As she stood behind Him at His feet weeping, she began to wet His feet with her tears and wipe them with her hair. Then she kissed His feet and anointed them with the perfume.
- **Luke 7:39**
When the Pharisee who had invited Jesus saw this, he said to himself, “If this man were a prophet, He would know who this is and what kind of woman is touching Him—for she is a sinner!”
- **Luke 7:40**
But Jesus answered him, “Simon, I have something to tell you.” “Tell me, Teacher,” he said.
- **Luke 7:41**
“Two men were debtors to a certain moneylender. One owed him five hundred denarii, and the other fifty.
- **Luke 7:42**
When they were unable to repay him, he forgave both of them. Which one, then, will love him more?”
- **Luke 7:43**
“I suppose the one who was forgiven more,” Simon replied. “You have judged correctly,” Jesus said.
- **Luke 7:44**
And turning toward the woman, He said to Simon, “Do you see this woman? When I entered your house, you did not give Me water for My feet, but she wet My feet with her tears and wiped them with her hair.
- **Luke 7:45**
You did not greet Me with a kiss, but she has not stopped kissing My feet since I arrived.
- **Luke 7:46**
You did not anoint My head with oil, but she has anointed My feet with perfume.
- **Luke 7:47**
Therefore I tell you, because her many sins have been forgiven, she has loved much. But he who has been forgiven little loves little.”
- **Luke 7:48**
Then Jesus said to her, “Your sins are forgiven.”
- **Luke 7:49**
But those at the table began to say to themselves, “Who is this who even forgives sins?”
- **Luke 7:50**
And Jesus told the woman, “Your faith has saved you; go in peace.”
- **Luke 8:1**
Soon afterward, Jesus traveled from one town and village to another, preaching and proclaiming the good news of the kingdom of God. The Twelve were with Him,
- **Luke 8:2**
as well as some women who had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities: Mary called Magdalene, from whom seven demons had gone out,
- **Luke 8:3**
Joanna the wife of Herod’s household manager Chuza, Susanna, and many others. These women were ministering to them out of their own means.
- **Luke 8:4**
While a large crowd was gathering and people were coming to Jesus from town after town, He told them this parable:
- **Luke 8:5**
“A farmer went out to sow his seed. And as he was sowing, some seed fell along the path, where it was trampled, and the birds of the air devoured it.
- **Luke 8:6**
Some fell on rocky ground, and when it came up, the seedlings withered because they had no moisture.
- **Luke 8:7**
Other seed fell among thorns, which grew up with it and choked the seedlings.
- **Luke 8:8**
Still other seed fell on good soil, where it sprang up and produced a crop—a hundredfold.” As Jesus said this, He called out, “He who has ears to hear, let him hear.”
- **Luke 8:9**
Then His disciples asked Him what this parable meant.
- **Luke 8:10**
He replied, “The knowledge of the mysteries of the kingdom of God has been given to you, but to others I speak in parables, so that, ‘though seeing, they may not see; though hearing, they may not understand.’
- **Luke 8:11**
Now this is the meaning of the parable: The seed is the word of God.
- **Luke 8:12**
The seeds along the path are those who hear, but the devil comes and takes away the word from their hearts, so that they may not believe and be saved.
- **Luke 8:13**
The seeds on rocky ground are those who hear the word and receive it with joy, but they have no root. They believe for a season, but in the time of testing, they fall away.
- **Luke 8:14**
The seeds that fell among the thorns are those who hear, but as they go on their way, they are choked by the worries, riches, and pleasures of this life, and their fruit does not mature.
- **Luke 8:15**
But the seeds on good soil are those with a noble and good heart, who hear the word, cling to it, and by persevering produce a crop.
- **Luke 8:16**
No one lights a lamp and covers it with a jar or puts it under a bed. Instead, he sets it on a stand, so those who enter can see the light.
- **Luke 8:17**
For there is nothing hidden that will not be disclosed, and nothing concealed that will not be made known and brought to light.
- **Luke 8:18**
Pay attention, therefore, to how you listen. Whoever has will be given more, but whoever does not have, even what he thinks he has will be taken away from him.”
- **Luke 8:19**
Then Jesus’ mother and brothers came to see Him, but they were unable to reach Him because of the crowd.
- **Luke 8:20**
He was told, “Your mother and brothers are standing outside, wanting to see You.”
- **Luke 8:21**
But He replied, “My mother and brothers are those who hear the word of God and carry it out.”
- **Luke 8:22**
One day Jesus said to His disciples, “Let us cross to the other side of the lake.” So He got into a boat with them and set out.
- **Luke 8:23**
As they sailed, He fell asleep, and a windstorm came down on the lake, so that the boat was being swamped, and they were in great danger.
- **Luke 8:24**
The disciples went and woke Him, saying, “Master, Master, we are perishing!” Then Jesus got up and rebuked the wind and the raging waters, and they subsided, and all was calm.
- **Luke 8:25**
“Where is your faith?” He asked. Frightened and amazed, they asked one another, “Who is this? He commands even the winds and the water, and they obey Him!”
- **Luke 8:26**
Then they sailed to the region of the Gerasenes, across the lake from Galilee.
- **Luke 8:27**
When Jesus stepped ashore, He was met by a demon-possessed man from the town. For a long time this man had not worn clothing or lived in a house, but he stayed in the tombs.
- **Luke 8:28**
When the man saw Jesus, he cried out and fell down before Him, shouting in a loud voice, “What do You want with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I beg You not to torture me!”
- **Luke 8:29**
For Jesus had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man. Many times it had seized him, and though he was bound with chains and shackles, he had broken the chains and been driven by the demon into solitary places.
- **Luke 8:30**
“What is your name?” Jesus asked. “Legion,” he replied, because many demons had gone into him.
- **Luke 8:31**
And the demons kept begging Jesus not to order them to go into the Abyss.
- **Luke 8:32**
There on the hillside a large herd of pigs was feeding. So the demons begged Jesus to let them enter the pigs, and He gave them permission.
- **Luke 8:33**
Then the demons came out of the man and went into the pigs, and the herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake and was drowned.
- **Luke 8:34**
When those tending the pigs saw what had happened, they ran off and reported this in the town and countryside.
- **Luke 8:35**
So the people went out to see what had happened. They came to Jesus and found the man whom the demons had left, sitting at Jesus’ feet, clothed and in his right mind; and they were afraid.
- **Luke 8:36**
Meanwhile, those who had seen it reported how the demon-possessed man had been healed.
- **Luke 8:37**
Then all the people of the region of the Gerasenes asked Jesus to depart from them, because great fear had taken hold of them. So He got into the boat and started back.
- **Luke 8:38**
The man whom the demons had left begged to go with Jesus. But He sent him away, saying,
- **Luke 8:39**
“Return home and describe how much God has done for you.” So the man went away and proclaimed all over the town how much Jesus had done for him.
- **Luke 8:40**
When Jesus returned, the crowd welcomed Him, for they had all been waiting for Him.
- **Luke 8:41**
Just then a synagogue leader named Jairus came and fell at Jesus’ feet. He begged Him to come to his house,
- **Luke 8:42**
because his only daughter, who was about twelve, was dying. As Jesus went with him, the crowds pressed around Him,
- **Luke 8:43**
including a woman who had suffered from bleeding for twelve years. She had spent all her money on physicians, but no one was able to heal her.
- **Luke 8:44**
She came up behind Jesus and touched the fringe of His cloak, and immediately her bleeding stopped.
- **Luke 8:45**
“Who touched Me?” Jesus asked. But they all denied it. “Master,” said Peter, “the people are crowding and pressing against You.”
- **Luke 8:46**
But Jesus declared, “Someone touched Me, for I know that power has gone out from Me.”
- **Luke 8:47**
Then the woman, seeing that she could not escape notice, came trembling and fell down before Him. In the presence of all the people, she explained why she had touched Him and how she had immediately been healed.
- **Luke 8:48**
“Daughter,” said Jesus, “your faith has healed you. Go in peace.”
- **Luke 8:49**
While He was still speaking, someone arrived from the house of the synagogue leader. “Your daughter is dead,” he told Jairus. “Do not bother the Teacher anymore.”
- **Luke 8:50**
But Jesus overheard them and said to Jairus, “Do not be afraid; just believe, and she will be healed.”
- **Luke 8:51**
When He entered the house, He did not allow anyone to go in with Him except Peter, John, James, and the child’s father and mother.
- **Luke 8:52**
Meanwhile, everyone was weeping and mourning for her. But Jesus said, “Stop weeping; she is not dead but asleep.”
- **Luke 8:53**
And they laughed at Him, knowing that she was dead.
- **Luke 8:54**
But Jesus took her by the hand and called out, “Child, get up!”
- **Luke 8:55**
Her spirit returned, and at once she got up. And He directed that she be given something to eat.
- **Luke 8:56**
Her parents were astounded, but Jesus ordered them not to tell anyone what had happened.
- **Luke 9:1**
Then Jesus called the Twelve together and gave them power and authority over all demons, and power to cure diseases.
- **Luke 9:2**
And He sent them out to proclaim the kingdom of God and to heal the sick.
- **Luke 9:3**
“Take nothing for the journey,” He told them, “no staff, no bag, no bread, no money, no second tunic.
- **Luke 9:4**
Whatever house you enter, stay there until you leave that area.
- **Luke 9:5**
If anyone does not welcome you, shake the dust off your feet when you leave that town, as a testimony against them.”
- **Luke 9:6**
So they set out and went from village to village, preaching the gospel and healing people everywhere.
- **Luke 9:7**
When Herod the tetrarch heard about all that was happening, he was perplexed. For some were saying that John had risen from the dead,
- **Luke 9:8**
others that Elijah had appeared, and still others that a prophet of old had arisen.
- **Luke 9:9**
“I beheaded John,” Herod said, “but who is this man I hear such things about?” And he kept trying to see Jesus.
- **Luke 9:10**
Then the apostles returned and reported to Jesus all that they had done. Taking them away privately, He withdrew to a town called Bethsaida.
- **Luke 9:11**
But the crowds found out and followed Him. He welcomed them and spoke to them about the kingdom of God, and He healed those who needed healing.
- **Luke 9:12**
As the day neared its end, the Twelve came to Jesus and said, “Dismiss the crowd so they can go to the surrounding villages and countryside for lodging and provisions. For we are in a desolate place here.”
- **Luke 9:13**
But Jesus told them, “You give them something to eat.” “We have only five loaves of bread and two fish,” they answered, “unless we go and buy food for all these people.”
- **Luke 9:14**
(There were about five thousand men.) He told His disciples, “Have them sit down in groups of about fifty each.”
- **Luke 9:15**
They did so, and everyone was seated.
- **Luke 9:16**
Taking the five loaves and the two fish and looking up to heaven, Jesus spoke a blessing and broke them. Then He gave them to the disciples to set before the people.
- **Luke 9:17**
They all ate and were satisfied, and the disciples picked up twelve basketfuls of broken pieces that were left over.
- **Luke 9:18**
One day as Jesus was praying in private and the disciples were with Him, He questioned them: “Who do the crowds say I am?”
- **Luke 9:19**
They replied, “Some say John the Baptist; others say Elijah; and still others, that a prophet of old has arisen.”
- **Luke 9:20**
“But what about you?” Jesus asked. “Who do you say I am?” Peter answered, “The Christ of God.”
- **Luke 9:21**
Jesus strictly warned them not to tell this to anyone.
- **Luke 9:22**
“The Son of Man must suffer many things,” He said. “He must be rejected by the elders, chief priests, and scribes, and He must be killed and on the third day be raised to life.”
- **Luke 9:23**
Then Jesus said to all of them, “If anyone wants to come after Me, he must deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow Me.
- **Luke 9:24**
For whoever wants to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for My sake will save it.
- **Luke 9:25**
What does it profit a man to gain the whole world, yet lose or forfeit his very self?
- **Luke 9:26**
If anyone is ashamed of Me and My words, the Son of Man will be ashamed of him when He comes in His glory and in the glory of the Father and of the holy angels.
- **Luke 9:27**
But I tell you truthfully, some who are standing here will not taste death before they see the kingdom of God.”
- **Luke 9:28**
About eight days after Jesus had said these things, He took with Him Peter, John, and James, and went up on a mountain to pray.
- **Luke 9:29**
And as He was praying, the appearance of His face changed, and His clothes became radiantly white.
- **Luke 9:30**
Suddenly two men, Moses and Elijah, began talking with Jesus.
- **Luke 9:31**
They appeared in glory and spoke about His departure, which He was about to accomplish at Jerusalem.
- **Luke 9:32**
Meanwhile Peter and his companions were overcome by sleep, but when they awoke, they saw Jesus’ glory and the two men standing with Him.
- **Luke 9:33**
As Moses and Elijah were leaving, Peter said to Jesus, “Master, it is good for us to be here. Let us put up three shelters—one for You, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.” (He did not know what he was saying.)
- **Luke 9:34**
While Peter was speaking, a cloud appeared and enveloped them, and they were afraid as they entered the cloud.
- **Luke 9:35**
And a voice came from the cloud, saying, “This is My Son, whom I have chosen. Listen to Him!”
- **Luke 9:36**
After the voice had spoken, only Jesus was present with them. The disciples kept this to themselves, and in those days they did not tell anyone what they had seen.
- **Luke 9:37**
The next day, when they came down from the mountain, Jesus was met by a large crowd.
- **Luke 9:38**
Suddenly a man in the crowd cried out, “Teacher, I beg You to look at my son, for he is my only child.
- **Luke 9:39**
A spirit keeps seizing him, and he screams abruptly. It throws him into convulsions so that he foams at the mouth. It keeps mauling him and rarely departs from him.
- **Luke 9:40**
I begged Your disciples to drive it out, but they were unable.”
- **Luke 9:41**
“O unbelieving and perverse generation!” Jesus replied. “How long must I remain with you and put up with you? Bring your son here.”
- **Luke 9:42**
Even while the boy was approaching, the demon slammed him to the ground in a convulsion. But Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, healed the boy, and gave him back to his father.
- **Luke 9:43**
And they were all astonished at the greatness of God. While everyone was marveling at all that Jesus was doing, He said to His disciples,
- **Luke 9:44**
“Let these words sink into your ears: The Son of Man is about to be delivered into the hands of men.”
- **Luke 9:45**
But they did not understand this statement. It was veiled from them so that they could not comprehend it, and they were afraid to ask Him about it.
- **Luke 9:46**
Then an argument started among the disciples as to which of them would be the greatest.
- **Luke 9:47**
But Jesus, knowing the thoughts of their hearts, had a little child stand beside Him.
- **Luke 9:48**
And He said to them, “Whoever welcomes this little child in My name welcomes Me, and whoever welcomes Me welcomes the One who sent Me. For whoever is the least among all of you, he is the greatest.”
- **Luke 9:49**
“Master,” said John, “we saw someone driving out demons in Your name, and we tried to stop him, because he does not accompany us.”
- **Luke 9:50**
“Do not stop him,” Jesus replied, “for whoever is not against you is for you.”
- **Luke 9:51**
As the day of His ascension approached, Jesus resolutely set out for Jerusalem.
- **Luke 9:52**
He sent messengers on ahead, who went into a village of the Samaritans to make arrangements for Him.
- **Luke 9:53**
But the people there refused to welcome Him, because He was heading for Jerusalem.
- **Luke 9:54**
When the disciples James and John saw this, they asked, “Lord, do You want us to call down fire from heaven to consume them?”
- **Luke 9:55**
But Jesus turned and rebuked them.
- **Luke 9:56**
And He and His disciples went on to another village.
- **Luke 9:57**
As they were walking along the road, someone said to Jesus, “I will follow You wherever You go.”
- **Luke 9:58**
Jesus replied, “Foxes have dens and birds of the air have nests, but the Son of Man has no place to lay His head.”
- **Luke 9:59**
Then He said to another man, “Follow Me.” The man replied, “Lord, first let me go and bury my father.”
- **Luke 9:60**
But Jesus told him, “Let the dead bury their own dead. You, however, go and proclaim the kingdom of God.”
- **Luke 9:61**
Still another said, “I will follow You, Lord; but first let me bid farewell to my family.”
- **Luke 9:62**
Then Jesus declared, “No one who puts his hand to the plow and then looks back is fit for the kingdom of God.”
- **Luke 10:1**
After this, the Lord appointed seventy-two others and sent them two by two ahead of Him to every town and place He was about to visit.
- **Luke 10:2**
And He told them, “The harvest is plentiful, but the workers are few. Ask the Lord of the harvest, therefore, to send out workers into His harvest.
- **Luke 10:3**
Go! I am sending you out like lambs among wolves.
- **Luke 10:4**
Carry no purse or bag or sandals. Do not greet anyone along the road.
- **Luke 10:5**
Whatever house you enter, begin by saying, ‘Peace to this house.’
- **Luke 10:6**
If a man of peace is there, your peace will rest on him; if not, it will return to you.
- **Luke 10:7**
Stay at the same house, eating and drinking whatever you are offered. For the worker is worthy of his wages. Do not move around from house to house.
- **Luke 10:8**
If you enter a town and they welcome you, eat whatever is set before you.
- **Luke 10:9**
Heal the sick who are there and tell them, ‘The kingdom of God is near you.’
- **Luke 10:10**
But if you enter a town and they do not welcome you, go into the streets and declare,
- **Luke 10:11**
‘Even the dust of your town that clings to our feet, we wipe off as a testimony against you. Yet be sure of this: The kingdom of God is near.’
- **Luke 10:12**
I tell you, it will be more bearable on that day for Sodom than for that town.
- **Luke 10:13**
Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the miracles that were performed in you had been performed in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago, sitting in sackcloth and ashes.
- **Luke 10:14**
But it will be more bearable for Tyre and Sidon at the judgment than for you.
- **Luke 10:15**
And you, Capernaum, will you be lifted up to heaven? No, you will be brought down to Hades!
- **Luke 10:16**
Whoever listens to you listens to Me; whoever rejects you rejects Me; and whoever rejects Me rejects the One who sent Me.”
- **Luke 10:17**
The seventy-two returned with joy and said, “Lord, even the demons submit to us in Your name.”
- **Luke 10:18**
So He told them, “I saw Satan fall like lightning from heaven.
- **Luke 10:19**
Behold, I have given you authority to tread on snakes and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy. Nothing will harm you.
- **Luke 10:20**
Nevertheless, do not rejoice that the spirits submit to you, but rejoice that your names are written in heaven.”
- **Luke 10:21**
At that time Jesus rejoiced in the Holy Spirit and declared, “I praise You, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because You have hidden these things from the wise and learned, and revealed them to little children. Yes, Father, for this was well-pleasing in Your sight.
- **Luke 10:22**
All things have been entrusted to Me by My Father. No one knows who the Son is except the Father, and no one knows who the Father is except the Son and those to whom the Son chooses to reveal Him.”
- **Luke 10:23**
Then Jesus turned to the disciples and said privately, “Blessed are the eyes that see what you see.
- **Luke 10:24**
For I tell you that many prophets and kings desired to see what you see but did not see it, and to hear what you hear but did not hear it.”
- **Luke 10:25**
One day an expert in the law stood up to test Him. “Teacher,” he asked, “what must I do to inherit eternal life?”
- **Luke 10:26**
“What is written in the Law?” Jesus replied. “How do you read it?”
- **Luke 10:27**
He answered, “‘Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength and with all your mind’ and ‘Love your neighbor as yourself.’”
- **Luke 10:28**
“You have answered correctly,” Jesus said. “Do this and you will live.”
- **Luke 10:29**
But wanting to justify himself, he asked Jesus, “And who is my neighbor?”
- **Luke 10:30**
Jesus took up this question and said, “A man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho when he fell into the hands of robbers. They stripped him, beat him, and went away, leaving him half dead.
- **Luke 10:31**
Now by chance a priest was going down the same road, but when he saw him, he passed by on the other side.
- **Luke 10:32**
So too, when a Levite came to that spot and saw him, he passed by on the other side.
- **Luke 10:33**
But when a Samaritan on a journey came upon him, he looked at him and had compassion.
- **Luke 10:34**
He went to him and bandaged his wounds, pouring on oil and wine. Then he put him on his own animal, brought him to an inn, and took care of him.
- **Luke 10:35**
The next day he took out two denarii and gave them to the innkeeper. ‘Take care of him,’ he said, ‘and on my return I will repay you for any additional expense.’
- **Luke 10:36**
Which of these three do you think was a neighbor to the man who fell into the hands of robbers?”
- **Luke 10:37**
“The one who showed him mercy,” replied the expert in the law. Then Jesus told him, “Go and do likewise.”
- **Luke 10:38**
As they traveled along, Jesus entered a village where a woman named Martha welcomed Him into her home.
- **Luke 10:39**
She had a sister named Mary, who sat at the Lord’s feet listening to His message.
- **Luke 10:40**
But Martha was distracted by all the preparations to be made. She came to Jesus and said, “Lord, do You not care that my sister has left me to serve alone? Tell her to help me!”
- **Luke 10:41**
“Martha, Martha,” the Lord replied, “you are worried and upset about many things.
- **Luke 10:42**
But only one thing is necessary. Mary has chosen the good portion, and it will not be taken away from her.”
- **Luke 11:1**
One day in a place where Jesus had just finished praying, one of His disciples requested, “Lord, teach us to pray, just as John taught his disciples.”
- **Luke 11:2**
So Jesus told them, “When you pray, say: ‘Father, hallowed be Your name. Your kingdom come.
- **Luke 11:3**
Give us each day our daily bread.
- **Luke 11:4**
And forgive us our sins, for we also forgive everyone who sins against us. And lead us not into temptation.’”
- **Luke 11:5**
Then Jesus said to them, “Suppose one of you goes to his friend at midnight and says, ‘Friend, lend me three loaves of bread,
- **Luke 11:6**
because a friend of mine has come to me on a journey, and I have nothing to set before him.’
- **Luke 11:7**
And suppose the one inside answers, ‘Do not bother me. My door is already shut, and my children and I are in bed. I cannot get up to give you anything.’
- **Luke 11:8**
I tell you, even though he will not get up to provide for him because of his friendship, yet because of the man’s persistence, he will get up and give him as much as he needs.
- **Luke 11:9**
So I tell you: Ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and the door will be opened to you.
- **Luke 11:10**
For everyone who asks receives; he who seeks finds; and to him who knocks, the door will be opened.
- **Luke 11:11**
What father among you, if his son asks for a fish, will give him a snake instead?
- **Luke 11:12**
Or if he asks for an egg, will give him a scorpion?
- **Luke 11:13**
So if you who are evil know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father in heaven give the Holy Spirit to those who ask Him!”
- **Luke 11:14**
One day Jesus was driving out a demon that was mute. And when the demon was gone, the man who had been mute spoke. The crowds were amazed,
- **Luke 11:15**
but some of them said, “It is by Beelzebul, the prince of the demons, that He drives out demons.”
- **Luke 11:16**
And others tested Him by demanding a sign from heaven.
- **Luke 11:17**
Knowing their thoughts, Jesus said to them, “Every kingdom divided against itself will be laid waste, and a house divided against a house will fall.
- **Luke 11:18**
If Satan is divided against himself, how can his kingdom stand? After all, you say that I drive out demons by Beelzebul.
- **Luke 11:19**
And if I drive out demons by Beelzebul, by whom do your sons drive them out? So then, they will be your judges.
- **Luke 11:20**
But if I drive out demons by the finger of God, then the kingdom of God has come upon you.
- **Luke 11:21**
When a strong man, fully armed, guards his house, his possessions are secure.
- **Luke 11:22**
But when someone stronger attacks and overpowers him, he takes away the armor in which the man trusted, and then he divides up his plunder.
- **Luke 11:23**
He who is not with Me is against Me, and he who does not gather with Me scatters.
- **Luke 11:24**
When an unclean spirit comes out of a man, it passes through arid places seeking rest and does not find it. Then it says, ‘I will return to the house I left.’
- **Luke 11:25**
On its return, it finds the house swept clean and put in order.
- **Luke 11:26**
Then it goes and brings seven other spirits more wicked than itself, and they go in and dwell there. And the final plight of that man is worse than the first.”
- **Luke 11:27**
As Jesus was saying these things, a woman in the crowd raised her voice and said, “Blessed is the womb that bore You, and blessed are the breasts that nursed You!”
- **Luke 11:28**
But He replied, “Blessed rather are those who hear the word of God and obey it.”
- **Luke 11:29**
As the crowds were increasing, Jesus said, “This is a wicked generation. It demands a sign, but none will be given it except the sign of Jonah.
- **Luke 11:30**
For as Jonah was a sign to the Ninevites, so the Son of Man will be a sign to this generation.
- **Luke 11:31**
The Queen of the South will rise at the judgment with the men of this generation and condemn them; for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and now One greater than Solomon is here.
- **Luke 11:32**
The men of Nineveh will stand at the judgment with this generation and condemn it; for they repented at the preaching of Jonah, and now One greater than Jonah is here.
- **Luke 11:33**
No one lights a lamp and puts it in a cellar or under a basket. Instead, he sets it on a stand, so those who enter can see the light.
- **Luke 11:34**
Your eye is the lamp of your body. When your eyes are good, your whole body also is full of light. But when they are bad, your body is full of darkness.
- **Luke 11:35**
Be careful, then, that the light within you is not darkness.
- **Luke 11:36**
So if your whole body is full of light, with no part of it in darkness, you will be radiant, as though a lamp were shining on you.”
- **Luke 11:37**
As Jesus was speaking, a Pharisee invited Him to dine with him; so He went in and reclined at the table.
- **Luke 11:38**
But the Pharisee was surprised to see that Jesus did not first wash before the meal.
- **Luke 11:39**
“Now then,” said the Lord, “you Pharisees clean the outside of the cup and dish, but inside you are full of greed and wickedness.
- **Luke 11:40**
You fools! Did not the One who made the outside make the inside as well?
- **Luke 11:41**
But give as alms the things that are within you, and you will see that everything is clean for you.
- **Luke 11:42**
Woe to you Pharisees! You pay tithes of mint, rue, and every herb, but you disregard justice and the love of God. You should have practiced the latter without neglecting the former.
- **Luke 11:43**
Woe to you Pharisees! You love the chief seats in the synagogues and the greetings in the marketplaces.
- **Luke 11:44**
Woe to you! For you are like unmarked graves, which men walk over without even noticing.”
- **Luke 11:45**
One of the experts in the law told Him, “Teacher, when You say these things, You insult us as well.”
- **Luke 11:46**
“Woe to you as well, experts in the law!” He replied. “You weigh men down with heavy burdens, but you yourselves will not lift a finger to lighten their load.
- **Luke 11:47**
Woe to you! You build tombs for the prophets, but it was your fathers who killed them.
- **Luke 11:48**
So you are witnesses consenting to the deeds of your fathers: They killed the prophets, and you build their tombs.
- **Luke 11:49**
Because of this, the wisdom of God said, ‘I will send them prophets and apostles; some of them they will kill and others they will persecute.’
- **Luke 11:50**
As a result, this generation will be charged with the blood of all the prophets that has been shed since the foundation of the world,
- **Luke 11:51**
from the blood of Abel to the blood of Zechariah, who was killed between the altar and the sanctuary. Yes, I tell you, all of it will be charged to this generation.
- **Luke 11:52**
Woe to you experts in the law! For you have taken away the key to knowledge. You yourselves have not entered, and you have hindered those who were entering.”
- **Luke 11:53**
As Jesus went on from there, the scribes and Pharisees began to oppose Him bitterly and to ply Him with questions about many things,
- **Luke 11:54**
waiting to catch Him in something He might say.
- **Luke 12:1**
In the meantime, a crowd of many thousands had gathered, so that they were trampling one another. Jesus began to speak first to His disciples: “Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy.
- **Luke 12:2**
There is nothing concealed that will not be disclosed, and nothing hidden that will not be made known.
- **Luke 12:3**
What you have spoken in the dark will be heard in the daylight, and what you have whispered in the inner rooms will be proclaimed from the housetops.
- **Luke 12:4**
I tell you, My friends, do not be afraid of those who kill the body and after that can do no more.
- **Luke 12:5**
But I will show you whom you should fear: Fear the One who, after you have been killed, has authority to throw you into hell. Yes, I tell you, fear Him!
- **Luke 12:6**
Are not five sparrows sold for two pennies? Yet not one of them is forgotten by God.
- **Luke 12:7**
And even the very hairs of your head are all numbered. So do not be afraid; you are worth more than many sparrows.
- **Luke 12:8**
I tell you, everyone who confesses Me before men, the Son of Man will also confess him before the angels of God.
- **Luke 12:9**
But whoever denies Me before men will be denied before the angels of God.
- **Luke 12:10**
And everyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven, but whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven.
- **Luke 12:11**
When you are brought before synagogues, rulers, and authorities, do not worry about how to defend yourselves or what to say.
- **Luke 12:12**
For at that time the Holy Spirit will teach you what you should say.”
- **Luke 12:13**
Someone in the crowd said to Him, “Teacher, tell my brother to divide the inheritance with me.”
- **Luke 12:14**
But Jesus replied, “Man, who appointed Me judge or executor between you?”
- **Luke 12:15**
And He said to them, “Watch out! Guard yourselves against every form of greed, for one’s life does not consist in the abundance of his possessions.”
- **Luke 12:16**
Then He told them a parable: “The ground of a certain rich man produced an abundance.
- **Luke 12:17**
So he thought to himself, ‘What shall I do, since I have nowhere to store my crops?’
- **Luke 12:18**
Then he said, ‘This is what I will do: I will tear down my barns and will build bigger ones, and there I will store up all my grain and my goods.
- **Luke 12:19**
Then I will say to myself, “You have plenty of good things laid up for many years. Take it easy. Eat, drink, and be merry!”’
- **Luke 12:20**
But God said to him, ‘You fool! This very night your life will be required of you. Then who will own what you have accumulated?’
- **Luke 12:21**
This is how it will be for anyone who stores up treasure for himself but is not rich toward God.”
- **Luke 12:22**
Then Jesus said to His disciples, “Therefore I tell you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat, or about your body, what you will wear.
- **Luke 12:23**
For life is more than food, and the body more than clothes.
- **Luke 12:24**
Consider the ravens: They do not sow or reap, they have no storehouse or barn; yet God feeds them. How much more valuable you are than the birds!
- **Luke 12:25**
Who of you by worrying can add a single hour to his life?
- **Luke 12:26**
So if you cannot do such a small thing, why do you worry about the rest?
- **Luke 12:27**
Consider how the lilies grow: They do not labor or spin. Yet I tell you, not even Solomon in all his glory was adorned like one of these.
- **Luke 12:28**
If that is how God clothes the grass of the field, which is here today and tomorrow is thrown into the furnace, how much more will He clothe you, O you of little faith!
- **Luke 12:29**
And do not be concerned about what you will eat or drink. Do not worry about it.
- **Luke 12:30**
For the Gentiles of the world strive after all these things, and your Father knows that you need them.
- **Luke 12:31**
But seek His kingdom, and these things will be added unto you.
- **Luke 12:32**
Do not be afraid, little flock, for your Father is pleased to give you the kingdom.
- **Luke 12:33**
Sell your possessions and give to the poor. Provide yourselves with purses that will not wear out, an inexhaustible treasure in heaven, where no thief approaches and no moth destroys.
- **Luke 12:34**
For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.
- **Luke 12:35**
Be dressed for service and keep your lamps burning.
- **Luke 12:36**
Then you will be like servants waiting for their master to return from the wedding banquet, so that when he comes and knocks, they can open the door for him at once.
- **Luke 12:37**
Blessed are those servants whom the master finds on watch when he returns. Truly I tell you, he will dress himself to serve and will have them recline at the table, and he himself will come and wait on them.
- **Luke 12:38**
Even if he comes in the second or third watch of the night and finds them alert, those servants will be blessed.
- **Luke 12:39**
But understand this: If the homeowner had known at what hour the thief was coming, he would not have let his house be broken into.
- **Luke 12:40**
You also must be ready, because the Son of Man will come at an hour you do not expect.”
- **Luke 12:41**
“Lord,” said Peter, “are You addressing this parable to us, or to everyone else as well?”
- **Luke 12:42**
And the Lord answered, “Who then is the faithful and wise manager, whom the master puts in charge of his servants to give them their portion at the proper time?
- **Luke 12:43**
Blessed is that servant whose master finds him doing so when he returns.
- **Luke 12:44**
Truly I tell you, he will put him in charge of all his possessions.
- **Luke 12:45**
But suppose that servant says in his heart, ‘My master will be a long time in coming,’ and he begins to beat the menservants and maidservants, and to eat and drink and get drunk.
- **Luke 12:46**
The master of that servant will come on a day he does not expect and at an hour he does not anticipate. Then he will cut him to pieces and assign him a place with the unbelievers.
- **Luke 12:47**
That servant who knows his master’s will but does not get ready or follow his instructions will be beaten with many blows.
- **Luke 12:48**
But the one who unknowingly does things worthy of punishment will be beaten with few blows. From everyone who has been given much, much will be required; and from him who has been entrusted with much, even more will be demanded.
- **Luke 12:49**
I have come to ignite a fire on the earth, and how I wish it were already kindled!
- **Luke 12:50**
But I have a baptism to undergo, and how distressed I am until it is accomplished!
- **Luke 12:51**
Do you think that I have come to bring peace to the earth? No, I tell you, but division.
- **Luke 12:52**
From now on, five in one household will be divided, three against two and two against three.
- **Luke 12:53**
They will be divided, father against son and son against father, mother against daughter and daughter against mother, mother-in-law against daughter-in-law and daughter-in-law against mother-in-law.”
- **Luke 12:54**
Then Jesus said to the crowds, “As soon as you see a cloud rising in the west, you say, ‘A shower is coming,’ and that is what happens.
- **Luke 12:55**
And when the south wind blows, you say, ‘It will be hot,’ and it is.
- **Luke 12:56**
You hypocrites! You know how to interpret the appearance of the earth and sky. Why don’t you know how to interpret the present time?
- **Luke 12:57**
And why don’t you judge for yourselves what is right?
- **Luke 12:58**
Make every effort to reconcile with your adversary while you are on your way to the magistrate. Otherwise, he may drag you off to the judge, and the judge may hand you over to the officer, and the officer may throw you into prison.
- **Luke 12:59**
I tell you, you will not get out until you have paid the very last penny.”
- **Luke 13:1**
At that time some of those present told Jesus about the Galileans whose blood Pilate had mixed with their sacrifices.
- **Luke 13:2**
To this He replied, “Do you think that these Galileans were worse sinners than all the other Galileans, because they suffered this fate?
- **Luke 13:3**
No, I tell you. But unless you repent, you too will all perish.
- **Luke 13:4**
Or those eighteen who were killed when the tower of Siloam collapsed on them: Do you think that they were more sinful than all the others living in Jerusalem?
- **Luke 13:5**
No, I tell you. But unless you repent, you too will all perish.”
- **Luke 13:6**
Then Jesus told this parable: “A man had a fig tree that was planted in his vineyard. He went to look for fruit on it, but did not find any.
- **Luke 13:7**
So he said to the keeper of the vineyard, ‘Look, for the past three years I have come to search for fruit on this fig tree and haven’t found any. Therefore cut it down! Why should it use up the soil?’
- **Luke 13:8**
‘Sir,’ the man replied, ‘leave it alone again this year, until I dig around it and fertilize it.
- **Luke 13:9**
If it bears fruit next year, fine. But if not, you can cut it down.’”
- **Luke 13:10**
One Sabbath Jesus was teaching in one of the synagogues,
- **Luke 13:11**
and a woman there had been disabled by a spirit for eighteen years. She was hunched over and could not stand up straight.
- **Luke 13:12**
When Jesus saw her, He called her over and said, “Woman, you are set free from your disability.”
- **Luke 13:13**
Then He placed His hands on her, and immediately she straightened up and began to glorify God.
- **Luke 13:14**
But the synagogue leader was indignant that Jesus had healed on the Sabbath. “There are six days for work,” he told the crowd. “So come and be healed on those days and not on the Sabbath.”
- **Luke 13:15**
“You hypocrites!” the Lord replied. “Does not each of you on the Sabbath untie his ox or donkey from the stall and lead it to water?
- **Luke 13:16**
Then should not this daughter of Abraham, whom Satan has kept bound for eighteen long years, be released from her bondage on the Sabbath day?”
- **Luke 13:17**
When Jesus said this, all His adversaries were humiliated. And the whole crowd rejoiced at all the glorious things He was doing.
- **Luke 13:18**
Then Jesus asked, “What is the kingdom of God like? To what can I compare it?
- **Luke 13:19**
It is like a mustard seed that a man tossed into his garden. It grew and became a tree, and the birds of the air nested in its branches.”
- **Luke 13:20**
Again He asked, “To what can I compare the kingdom of God?
- **Luke 13:21**
It is like leaven that a woman took and mixed into three measures of flour, until all of it was leavened.”
- **Luke 13:22**
Then Jesus traveled throughout the towns and villages, teaching as He made His way toward Jerusalem.
- **Luke 13:23**
“Lord,” someone asked Him, “will only a few people be saved?” Jesus answered,
- **Luke 13:24**
“Make every effort to enter through the narrow door. For many, I tell you, will try to enter and will not be able.
- **Luke 13:25**
After the master of the house gets up and shuts the door, you will stand outside knocking and saying, ‘Lord, open the door for us.’ But he will reply, ‘I do not know where you are from.’
- **Luke 13:26**
Then you will say, ‘We ate and drank with you, and you taught in our streets.’
- **Luke 13:27**
And he will answer, ‘I tell you, I do not know where you are from. Depart from me, all you evildoers.’
- **Luke 13:28**
There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth when you see Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and all the prophets in the kingdom of God, but you yourselves are thrown out.
- **Luke 13:29**
People will come from east and west and north and south, and will recline at the table in the kingdom of God.
- **Luke 13:30**
And indeed, some who are last will be first, and some who are first will be last.”
- **Luke 13:31**
At that very hour, some Pharisees came to Jesus and told Him, “Leave this place and get away, because Herod wants to kill You.”
- **Luke 13:32**
But Jesus replied, “Go tell that fox, ‘Look, I will keep driving out demons and healing people today and tomorrow, and on the third day I will reach My goal.’
- **Luke 13:33**
Nevertheless, I must keep going today and tomorrow and the next day, for it is not admissible for a prophet to perish outside of Jerusalem.
- **Luke 13:34**
O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, who kills the prophets and stones those sent to her, how often I have longed to gather your children together as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, but you were unwilling!
- **Luke 13:35**
Look, your house is left to you desolate. And I tell you that you will not see Me again until you say, ‘Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord.’”
- **Luke 14:1**
One Sabbath, Jesus went to eat in the home of a leading Pharisee, and those in attendance were watching Him closely.
- **Luke 14:2**
Right there before Him was a man with dropsy.
- **Luke 14:3**
So Jesus asked the experts in the law and the Pharisees, “Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath or not?”
- **Luke 14:4**
But they remained silent. Then Jesus took hold of the man, healed him, and sent him on his way.
- **Luke 14:5**
And He asked them, “Which of you whose son or ox falls into a pit on the Sabbath day will not immediately pull him out?”
- **Luke 14:6**
And they were unable to answer these questions.
- **Luke 14:7**
When Jesus noticed how the guests chose the places of honor, He told them a parable:
- **Luke 14:8**
“When you are invited to a wedding banquet, do not sit in the place of honor, in case someone more distinguished than you has been invited.
- **Luke 14:9**
Then the host who invited both of you will come and tell you, ‘Give this man your seat.’ And in humiliation, you will have to take the last place.
- **Luke 14:10**
But when you are invited, go and sit in the last place, so that your host will come and tell you, ‘Friend, move up to a better place.’ Then you will be honored in front of everyone at the table with you.
- **Luke 14:11**
For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, and the one who humbles himself will be exalted.”
- **Luke 14:12**
Then Jesus said to the man who had invited Him, “When you host a dinner or a banquet, do not invite your friends or brothers or relatives or rich neighbors. Otherwise, they may invite you in return, and you will be repaid.
- **Luke 14:13**
But when you host a banquet, invite the poor, the crippled, the lame, and the blind,
- **Luke 14:14**
and you will be blessed. Since they cannot repay you, you will be repaid at the resurrection of the righteous.”
- **Luke 14:15**
When one of those reclining with Him heard this, he said to Jesus, “Blessed is everyone who will eat at the feast in the kingdom of God.”
- **Luke 14:16**
But Jesus replied, “A certain man prepared a great banquet and invited many guests.
- **Luke 14:17**
When it was time for the banquet, he sent his servant to tell those who had been invited, ‘Come, for everything is now ready.’
- **Luke 14:18**
But one after another they all began to make excuses. The first one said, ‘I have bought a field, and I need to go see it. Please excuse me.’
- **Luke 14:19**
Another said, ‘I have bought five yoke of oxen, and I am going to try them out. Please excuse me.’
- **Luke 14:20**
Still another said, ‘I have married a wife, so I cannot come.’
- **Luke 14:21**
The servant returned and reported all this to his master. Then the owner of the house became angry and said to his servant, ‘Go out quickly into the streets and alleys of the city, and bring in the poor, the crippled, the blind, and the lame.’
- **Luke 14:22**
‘Sir,’ the servant replied, ‘what you ordered has been done, and there is still room.’
- **Luke 14:23**
So the master told his servant, ‘Go out to the highways and hedges and compel them to come in, so that my house will be full.
- **Luke 14:24**
For I tell you, not one of those men who were invited will taste my banquet.’”
- **Luke 14:25**
Large crowds were now traveling with Jesus, and He turned and said to them,
- **Luke 14:26**
“If anyone comes to Me and does not hate his father and mother and wife and children and brothers and sisters—yes, even his own life—he cannot be My disciple.
- **Luke 14:27**
And whoever does not carry his cross and follow Me cannot be My disciple.
- **Luke 14:28**
Which of you, wishing to build a tower, does not first sit down and count the cost to see if he has the resources to complete it?
- **Luke 14:29**
Otherwise, if he lays the foundation and is unable to finish the work, everyone who sees it will ridicule him,
- **Luke 14:30**
saying, ‘This man could not finish what he started to build.’
- **Luke 14:31**
Or what king on his way to war with another king will not first sit down and consider whether he can engage with ten thousand men the one coming against him with twenty thousand?
- **Luke 14:32**
And if he is unable, he will send a delegation while the other king is still far off, to ask for terms of peace.
- **Luke 14:33**
In the same way, any one of you who does not give up everything he has cannot be My disciple.
- **Luke 14:34**
Salt is good, but if the salt loses its savor, with what will it be seasoned?
- **Luke 14:35**
It is fit neither for the soil nor for the manure pile, and it is thrown out. He who has ears to hear, let him hear.”
- **Luke 15:1**
Now all the tax collectors and sinners were gathering around to listen to Jesus.
- **Luke 15:2**
So the Pharisees and scribes began to grumble: “This man welcomes sinners and eats with them.”
- **Luke 15:3**
Then Jesus told them this parable:
- **Luke 15:4**
“What man among you, if he has a hundred sheep and loses one of them, does not leave the ninety-nine in the pasture and go after the one that is lost, until he finds it?
- **Luke 15:5**
And when he finds it, he joyfully puts it on his shoulders,
- **Luke 15:6**
comes home, and calls together his friends and neighbors to tell them, ‘Rejoice with me, for I have found my lost sheep!’
- **Luke 15:7**
In the same way, I tell you that there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine righteous ones who do not need to repent.
- **Luke 15:8**
Or what woman who has ten silver coins and loses one of them does not light a lamp, sweep her house, and search carefully until she finds it?
- **Luke 15:9**
And when she finds it, she calls together her friends and neighbors to say, ‘Rejoice with me, for I have found my lost coin.’
- **Luke 15:10**
In the same way, I tell you, there is joy in the presence of God’s angels over one sinner who repents.”
- **Luke 15:11**
Then Jesus said, “There was a man who had two sons.
- **Luke 15:12**
The younger son said to him, ‘Father, give me my share of the estate.’ So he divided his property between them.
- **Luke 15:13**
After a few days, the younger son got everything together and journeyed to a distant country, where he squandered his wealth in wild living.
- **Luke 15:14**
After he had spent all he had, a severe famine swept through that country, and he began to be in need.
- **Luke 15:15**
So he went and hired himself out to a citizen of that country, who sent him into his fields to feed the pigs.
- **Luke 15:16**
He longed to fill his belly with the pods the pigs were eating, but no one would give him a thing.
- **Luke 15:17**
Finally he came to his senses and said, ‘How many of my father’s hired servants have plenty of food? But here I am, starving to death!
- **Luke 15:18**
I will get up and go back to my father and say to him, “Father, I have sinned against heaven and against you.
- **Luke 15:19**
I am no longer worthy to be called your son. Make me like one of your hired servants.”’
- **Luke 15:20**
So he got up and went to his father. But while he was still in the distance, his father saw him and was filled with compassion. He ran to his son, embraced him, and kissed him.
- **Luke 15:21**
The son declared, ‘Father, I have sinned against heaven and against you. I am no longer worthy to be called your son.’
- **Luke 15:22**
But the father said to his servants, ‘Quick! Bring the best robe and put it on him. Put a ring on his finger and sandals on his feet.
- **Luke 15:23**
Bring the fattened calf and kill it. Let us feast and celebrate.
- **Luke 15:24**
For this son of mine was dead and is alive again! He was lost and is found!’ So they began to celebrate.
- **Luke 15:25**
Meanwhile the older son was in the field, and as he approached the house, he heard music and dancing.
- **Luke 15:26**
So he called one of the servants and asked what was going on.
- **Luke 15:27**
‘Your brother has returned,’ he said, ‘and your father has killed the fattened calf, because he has him back safe and sound.’
- **Luke 15:28**
The older son became angry and refused to go in. So his father came out and pleaded with him.
- **Luke 15:29**
But he answered his father, ‘Look, all these years I have served you and never disobeyed a commandment of yours. Yet you never gave me even a young goat so I could celebrate with my friends.
- **Luke 15:30**
But when this son of yours returns from squandering your wealth with prostitutes, you kill the fattened calf for him!’
- **Luke 15:31**
‘Son, you are always with me,’ the father said, ‘and all that is mine is yours.
- **Luke 15:32**
But it was fitting to celebrate and be glad, because this brother of yours was dead and is alive again; he was lost and is found.’”
- **Luke 16:1**
Jesus also said to His disciples, “There was a rich man whose manager was accused of wasting his possessions.
- **Luke 16:2**
So he called him in to ask, ‘What is this I hear about you? Turn in an account of your management, for you cannot be manager any longer.’
- **Luke 16:3**
The manager said to himself, ‘What shall I do, now that my master is taking away my position? I am too weak to dig and too ashamed to beg.
- **Luke 16:4**
I know what I will do, so that after my removal from management, people will welcome me into their homes.’
- **Luke 16:5**
And he called in each one of his master’s debtors. ‘How much do you owe my master?’ he asked the first.
- **Luke 16:6**
‘A hundred measures of olive oil,’ he answered. ‘Take your bill,’ said the manager. ‘Sit down quickly, and write fifty.’
- **Luke 16:7**
Then he asked another, ‘And how much do you owe?’ ‘A hundred measures of wheat,’ he replied. ‘Take your bill and write eighty,’ he told him.
- **Luke 16:8**
The master commended the dishonest manager because he had acted shrewdly. For the sons of this age are more shrewd in dealing with their own kind than are the sons of light.
- **Luke 16:9**
I tell you, use worldly wealth to make friends for yourselves, so that when it is gone, they will welcome you into eternal dwellings.
- **Luke 16:10**
Whoever is faithful with very little will also be faithful with much, and whoever is dishonest with very little will also be dishonest with much.
- **Luke 16:11**
So if you have not been faithful with worldly wealth, who will entrust you with true riches?
- **Luke 16:12**
And if you have not been faithful with the belongings of another, who will give you belongings of your own?
- **Luke 16:13**
No servant can serve two masters. Either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve both God and money.”
- **Luke 16:14**
The Pharisees, who were lovers of money, heard all of this and were scoffing at Jesus.
- **Luke 16:15**
So He said to them, “You are the ones who justify yourselves before men, but God knows your hearts. For what is prized among men is detestable before God.
- **Luke 16:16**
The Law and the Prophets were proclaimed until John. Since that time, the gospel of the kingdom of God is being preached, and everyone is forcing his way into it.
- **Luke 16:17**
But it is easier for heaven and earth to pass away than for a single stroke of a pen to drop out of the Law.
- **Luke 16:18**
Anyone who divorces his wife and marries another woman commits adultery, and he who marries a divorced woman commits adultery.
- **Luke 16:19**
Now there was a rich man dressed in purple and fine linen, who lived each day in joyous splendor.
- **Luke 16:20**
And a beggar named Lazarus lay at his gate, covered with sores
- **Luke 16:21**
and longing to be fed with the crumbs that fell from the rich man’s table. Even the dogs came and licked his sores.
- **Luke 16:22**
One day the beggar died and was carried by the angels to Abraham’s side. And the rich man also died and was buried.
- **Luke 16:23**
In Hades, where he was in torment, he looked up and saw Abraham from afar, with Lazarus by his side.
- **Luke 16:24**
So he cried out, ‘Father Abraham, have mercy on me and send Lazarus to dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue. For I am in agony in this fire.’
- **Luke 16:25**
But Abraham answered, ‘Child, remember that during your lifetime you received your good things, while Lazarus received bad things. But now he is comforted here, while you are in agony.
- **Luke 16:26**
And besides all this, a great chasm has been fixed between us and you, so that even those who wish cannot cross from here to you, nor can anyone cross from there to us.’
- **Luke 16:27**
‘Then I beg you, father,’ he said, ‘send Lazarus to my father’s house,
- **Luke 16:28**
for I have five brothers. Let him warn them, so that they will not also end up in this place of torment.’
- **Luke 16:29**
But Abraham replied, ‘They have Moses and the prophets; let your brothers listen to them.’
- **Luke 16:30**
‘No, father Abraham,’ he said, ‘but if someone is sent to them from the dead, they will repent.’
- **Luke 16:31**
Then Abraham said to him, ‘If they do not listen to Moses and the prophets, they will not be persuaded even if someone rises from the dead.’”
- **Luke 17:1**
Jesus said to His disciples, “It is inevitable that stumbling blocks will come, but woe to the one through whom they come!
- **Luke 17:2**
It would be better for him to have a millstone hung around his neck and to be thrown into the sea than to cause one of these little ones to stumble.
- **Luke 17:3**
Watch yourselves. If your brother sins, rebuke him; and if he repents, forgive him.
- **Luke 17:4**
Even if he sins against you seven times in a day, and seven times returns to say, ‘I repent,’ you must forgive him.”
- **Luke 17:5**
The apostles said to the Lord, “Increase our faith!”
- **Luke 17:6**
And the Lord answered, “If you have faith the size of a mustard seed, you can say to this mulberry tree, ‘Be uprooted and planted in the sea,’ and it will obey you.
- **Luke 17:7**
Which of you whose servant comes in from plowing or shepherding in the field will say to him, ‘Come at once and sit down to eat’?
- **Luke 17:8**
Instead, won’t he tell him, ‘Prepare my meal and dress yourself to serve me while I eat and drink; and afterward you may eat and drink’?
- **Luke 17:9**
Does he thank the servant because he did what he was told?
- **Luke 17:10**
So you also, when you have done everything commanded of you, should say, ‘We are unworthy servants; we have only done our duty.’”
- **Luke 17:11**
While Jesus was on His way to Jerusalem, He was passing between Samaria and Galilee.
- **Luke 17:12**
As He entered one of the villages, He was met by ten lepers. They stood at a distance
- **Luke 17:13**
and raised their voices, shouting, “Jesus, Master, have mercy on us!”
- **Luke 17:14**
When Jesus saw them, He said, “Go, show yourselves to the priests.” And as they were on their way, they were cleansed.
- **Luke 17:15**
When one of them saw that he was healed, he came back, praising God in a loud voice.
- **Luke 17:16**
He fell facedown at Jesus’ feet in thanksgiving to Him—and he was a Samaritan.
- **Luke 17:17**
“Were not all ten cleansed?” Jesus asked. “Where then are the other nine?
- **Luke 17:18**
Was no one found except this foreigner to return and give glory to God?”
- **Luke 17:19**
Then Jesus said to him, “Rise and go; your faith has made you well!”
- **Luke 17:20**
When asked by the Pharisees when the kingdom of God would come, Jesus replied, “The kingdom of God will not come with observable signs.
- **Luke 17:21**
Nor will people say, ‘Look, here it is,’ or ‘There it is.’ For you see, the kingdom of God is in your midst.”
- **Luke 17:22**
Then He said to the disciples, “The time is coming when you will long to see one of the days of the Son of Man, but you will not see it.
- **Luke 17:23**
People will tell you, ‘Look, there He is!’ or ‘Look, here He is!’ Do not go out or chase after them.
- **Luke 17:24**
For just as the lightning flashes and lights up the sky from one end to the other, so will be the Son of Man in His day.
- **Luke 17:25**
But first He must suffer many things and be rejected by this generation.
- **Luke 17:26**
Just as it was in the days of Noah, so also will it be in the days of the Son of Man:
- **Luke 17:27**
People were eating and drinking, marrying and being given in marriage, up to the day Noah entered the ark. Then the flood came and destroyed them all.
- **Luke 17:28**
It was the same in the days of Lot: People were eating and drinking, buying and selling, planting and building.
- **Luke 17:29**
But on the day Lot left Sodom, fire and sulfur rained down from heaven and destroyed them all.
- **Luke 17:30**
It will be just like that on the day the Son of Man is revealed.
- **Luke 17:31**
On that day, let no one on the housetop come down to retrieve his possessions. Likewise, let no one in the field return for anything he has left behind.
- **Luke 17:32**
Remember Lot’s wife!
- **Luke 17:33**
Whoever tries to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life will preserve it.
- **Luke 17:34**
I tell you, on that night two people will be in one bed: One will be taken and the other left.
- **Luke 17:35**
Two women will be grinding grain together: One will be taken and the other left.”
- **Luke 17:36**

- **Luke 17:37**
“Where, Lord?” they asked. Jesus answered, “Wherever there is a carcass, there the vultures will gather.”
- **Luke 18:1**
Then Jesus told them a parable about their need to pray at all times and not lose heart:
- **Luke 18:2**
“In a certain town there was a judge who neither feared God nor respected men.
- **Luke 18:3**
And there was a widow in that town who kept appealing to him, ‘Give me justice against my adversary.’
- **Luke 18:4**
For a while he refused, but later he said to himself, ‘Though I neither fear God nor respect men,
- **Luke 18:5**
yet because this widow keeps pestering me, I will give her justice. Then she will stop wearing me out with her perpetual requests.’”
- **Luke 18:6**
And the Lord said, “Listen to the words of the unjust judge.
- **Luke 18:7**
Will not God bring about justice for His elect who cry out to Him day and night? Will He continue to defer their help?
- **Luke 18:8**
I tell you, He will promptly carry out justice on their behalf. Nevertheless, when the Son of Man comes, will He find faith on earth?”
- **Luke 18:9**
To some who trusted in their own righteousness and viewed others with contempt, He also told this parable:
- **Luke 18:10**
“Two men went up to the temple to pray. One was a Pharisee and the other a tax collector.
- **Luke 18:11**
The Pharisee stood by himself and prayed, ‘God, I thank You that I am not like the other men—swindlers, evildoers, adulterers—or even like this tax collector.
- **Luke 18:12**
I fast twice a week and pay tithes of all that I acquire.’
- **Luke 18:13**
But the tax collector stood at a distance, unwilling even to lift up his eyes to heaven. Instead, he beat his breast and said, ‘God, have mercy on me, a sinner!’
- **Luke 18:14**
I tell you, this man, rather than the Pharisee, went home justified. For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, but the one who humbles himself will be exalted.”
- **Luke 18:15**
Now people were even bringing their babies to Jesus for Him to place His hands on them. And when the disciples saw this, they rebuked those who brought them.
- **Luke 18:16**
But Jesus called the children to Him and said, “Let the little children come to Me, and do not hinder them! For the kingdom of God belongs to such as these.
- **Luke 18:17**
Truly I tell you, anyone who does not receive the kingdom of God like a little child will never enter it.”
- **Luke 18:18**
Then a certain ruler asked Him, “Good Teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?”
- **Luke 18:19**
“Why do you call Me good?” Jesus replied. “No one is good except God alone.
- **Luke 18:20**
You know the commandments: ‘Do not commit adultery, do not murder, do not steal, do not bear false witness, honor your father and mother.’”
- **Luke 18:21**
“All these I have kept from my youth,” he said.
- **Luke 18:22**
On hearing this, Jesus told him, “You still lack one thing: Sell everything you own and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow Me.”
- **Luke 18:23**
But when the ruler heard this, he became very sad, because he was extremely wealthy.
- **Luke 18:24**
Seeing the man’s sadness, Jesus said, “How hard it is for the rich to enter the kingdom of God!
- **Luke 18:25**
Indeed, it is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.”
- **Luke 18:26**
Those who heard this asked, “Who then can be saved?”
- **Luke 18:27**
But Jesus said, “What is impossible with man is possible with God.”
- **Luke 18:28**
“Look,” said Peter, “we have left all we had to follow You.”
- **Luke 18:29**
“Truly I tell you,” Jesus replied, “no one who has left home or wife or brothers or parents or children for the sake of the kingdom of God
- **Luke 18:30**
will fail to receive many times more in this age—and in the age to come, eternal life.”
- **Luke 18:31**
Then Jesus took the Twelve aside and said to them, “Look, we are going up to Jerusalem, and everything the prophets have written about the Son of Man will be fulfilled.
- **Luke 18:32**
He will be delivered over to the Gentiles and will be mocked and insulted and spit upon.
- **Luke 18:33**
They will flog Him and kill Him, and on the third day He will rise again.”
- **Luke 18:34**
But the disciples did not understand any of these things. The meaning was hidden from them, and they did not comprehend what He was saying.
- **Luke 18:35**
As Jesus drew near to Jericho, a blind man was sitting beside the road, begging.
- **Luke 18:36**
When he heard the crowd going by, he asked what was happening.
- **Luke 18:37**
“Jesus of Nazareth is passing by,” they told him.
- **Luke 18:38**
So he called out, “Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!”
- **Luke 18:39**
Those who led the way admonished him to be silent, but he cried out all the louder, “Son of David, have mercy on me!”
- **Luke 18:40**
Jesus stopped and directed that the man be brought to Him. When he had been brought near, Jesus asked him,
- **Luke 18:41**
“What do you want Me to do for you?” “Lord,” he said, “let me see again.”
- **Luke 18:42**
“Receive your sight!” Jesus replied. “Your faith has healed you.”
- **Luke 18:43**
Immediately he received his sight and followed Jesus, glorifying God. And all the people who saw this gave praise to God.
- **Luke 19:1**
Then Jesus entered Jericho and was passing through.
- **Luke 19:2**
And there was a man named Zacchaeus, a chief tax collector, who was very wealthy.
- **Luke 19:3**
He was trying to see who Jesus was, but could not see over the crowd because he was small in stature.
- **Luke 19:4**
So he ran on ahead and climbed a sycamore tree to see Him, since Jesus was about to pass that way.
- **Luke 19:5**
When Jesus came to that place, He looked up and said, “Zacchaeus, hurry down, for I must stay at your house today.”
- **Luke 19:6**
So Zacchaeus hurried down and welcomed Him joyfully.
- **Luke 19:7**
And all who saw this began to grumble, saying, “He has gone to be the guest of a sinful man!”
- **Luke 19:8**
But Zacchaeus stood up and said to the Lord, “Look, Lord, half of my possessions I give to the poor, and if I have cheated anyone, I will repay it fourfold.”
- **Luke 19:9**
Jesus said to him, “Today salvation has come to this house, because this man too is a son of Abraham.
- **Luke 19:10**
For the Son of Man came to seek and to save the lost.”
- **Luke 19:11**
While the people were listening to this, Jesus proceeded to tell them a parable, because He was near Jerusalem and they thought the kingdom of God would appear imminently.
- **Luke 19:12**
So He said, “A man of noble birth went to a distant country to lay claim to his kingship and then return.
- **Luke 19:13**
Beforehand, he called ten of his servants and gave them ten minas. ‘Conduct business with this until I return,’ he said.
- **Luke 19:14**
But his subjects hated him and sent a delegation after him to say, ‘We do not want this man to rule over us.’
- **Luke 19:15**
When he returned from procuring his kingship, he summoned the servants to whom he had given the money, to find out what each one had earned.
- **Luke 19:16**
The first servant came forward and said, ‘Master, your mina has produced ten more minas.’
- **Luke 19:17**
His master replied, ‘Well done, good servant! Because you have been faithful in a very small matter, you shall have authority over ten cities.’
- **Luke 19:18**
The second servant came and said, ‘Master, your mina has made five minas.’
- **Luke 19:19**
And to this one he said, ‘You shall have authority over five cities.’
- **Luke 19:20**
Then another servant came and said, ‘Master, here is your mina, which I have laid away in a piece of cloth.
- **Luke 19:21**
For I was afraid of you, because you are a harsh man. You withdraw what you did not deposit and reap what you did not sow.’
- **Luke 19:22**
His master replied, ‘You wicked servant, I will judge you by your own words. So you knew that I am a harsh man, withdrawing what I did not deposit and reaping what I did not sow?
- **Luke 19:23**
Why then did you not deposit my money in the bank, and upon my return I could have collected it with interest?’
- **Luke 19:24**
Then he told those standing by, ‘Take the mina from him and give it to the one who has ten minas.’
- **Luke 19:25**
‘Master,’ they said, ‘he already has ten!’
- **Luke 19:26**
He replied, ‘I tell you that everyone who has will be given more; but the one who does not have, even what he has will be taken away from him.
- **Luke 19:27**
And these enemies of mine who were unwilling for me to rule over them, bring them here and slay them in front of me.’”
- **Luke 19:28**
After Jesus had said this, He went on ahead, going up to Jerusalem.
- **Luke 19:29**
As He approached Bethphage and Bethany at the Mount of Olives, He sent out two of His disciples,
- **Luke 19:30**
saying, “Go into the village ahead of you, and as you enter it, you will find a colt tied there, on which no one has ever sat. Untie it and bring it here.
- **Luke 19:31**
If anyone asks, ‘Why are you untying it?’ tell him, ‘The Lord needs it.’”
- **Luke 19:32**
So those who were sent went out and found it just as Jesus had told them.
- **Luke 19:33**
As they were untying the colt, its owners asked, “Why are you untying the colt?”
- **Luke 19:34**
“The Lord needs it,” they answered.
- **Luke 19:35**
Then they led the colt to Jesus, threw their cloaks over it, and put Jesus on it.
- **Luke 19:36**
As He rode along, the people spread their cloaks on the road.
- **Luke 19:37**
And as He approached the descent from the Mount of Olives, the whole multitude of disciples began to praise God joyfully in a loud voice for all the miracles they had seen:
- **Luke 19:38**
“Blessed is the King who comes in the name of the Lord!” “Peace in heaven and glory in the highest!”
- **Luke 19:39**
But some of the Pharisees in the crowd said to Him, “Teacher, rebuke Your disciples!”
- **Luke 19:40**
“I tell you,” He answered, “if they remain silent, the very stones will cry out.”
- **Luke 19:41**
As Jesus approached Jerusalem and saw the city, He wept over it
- **Luke 19:42**
and said, “If only you had known on this day what would bring you peace! But now it is hidden from your eyes.
- **Luke 19:43**
For the days will come upon you when your enemies will barricade you and surround you and hem you in on every side.
- **Luke 19:44**
They will level you to the ground—you and the children within your walls. They will not leave one stone on another, because you did not recognize the time of your visitation from God.”
- **Luke 19:45**
Then Jesus entered the temple courts and began to drive out those who were selling there.
- **Luke 19:46**
He declared to them, “It is written: ‘My house will be a house of prayer.’ But you have made it ‘a den of robbers.’”
- **Luke 19:47**
Jesus was teaching at the temple every day, but the chief priests, scribes, and leaders of the people were intent on killing Him.
- **Luke 19:48**
Yet they could not find a way to do so, because all the people hung on His words.
- **Luke 20:1**
One day as Jesus was teaching the people in the temple courts and proclaiming the gospel, the chief priests and scribes, together with the elders, came up to Him.
- **Luke 20:2**
“Tell us,” they said, “by what authority are You doing these things, and who gave You this authority?”
- **Luke 20:3**
“I will also ask you a question,” Jesus replied. “Tell Me:
- **Luke 20:4**
John’s baptism—was it from heaven, or from men?”
- **Luke 20:5**
They deliberated among themselves and said, “If we say, ‘From heaven,’ He will ask, ‘Why did you not believe him?’
- **Luke 20:6**
But if we say, ‘From men,’ all the people will stone us, for they are convinced that John was a prophet.”
- **Luke 20:7**
So they answered that they did not know where it was from.
- **Luke 20:8**
And Jesus replied, “Neither will I tell you by what authority I am doing these things.”
- **Luke 20:9**
Then He proceeded to tell the people this parable: “A man planted a vineyard, rented it out to some tenants, and went away for a long time.
- **Luke 20:10**
At harvest time, he sent a servant to the tenants to collect his share of the fruit of the vineyard. But the tenants beat the servant and sent him away empty-handed.
- **Luke 20:11**
So he sent another servant, but they beat him and treated him shamefully, sending him away empty-handed.
- **Luke 20:12**
Then he sent a third, but they wounded him and threw him out.
- **Luke 20:13**
‘What shall I do?’ asked the owner of the vineyard. ‘I will send my beloved son. Perhaps they will respect him.’
- **Luke 20:14**
But when the tenants saw the son, they discussed it among themselves and said, ‘This is the heir. Let us kill him, and the inheritance will be ours.’
- **Luke 20:15**
So they threw him out of the vineyard and killed him. What then will the owner of the vineyard do to them?
- **Luke 20:16**
He will come and kill those tenants, and will give the vineyard to others.” And when the people heard this, they said, “May such a thing never happen!”
- **Luke 20:17**
But Jesus looked directly at them and said, “Then what is the meaning of that which is written: ‘The stone the builders rejected has become the cornerstone’?
- **Luke 20:18**
Everyone who falls on this stone will be broken to pieces, but he on whom it falls will be crushed.”
- **Luke 20:19**
When the scribes and chief priests realized that Jesus had spoken this parable against them, they sought to arrest Him that very hour. But they were afraid of the people.
- **Luke 20:20**
So they watched Him closely and sent spies who pretended to be sincere. They were hoping to catch Him in His words in order to hand Him over to the rule and authority of the governor.
- **Luke 20:21**
“Teacher,” they inquired, “we know that You speak and teach correctly. You show no partiality, but teach the way of God in accordance with the truth.
- **Luke 20:22**
Is it lawful for us to pay taxes to Caesar or not?”
- **Luke 20:23**
But Jesus saw through their duplicity and said to them,
- **Luke 20:24**
“Show Me a denarius. Whose image and inscription are on it?” “Caesar’s,” they answered.
- **Luke 20:25**
So Jesus told them, “Give to Caesar what is Caesar’s, and to God what is God’s.”
- **Luke 20:26**
And they were unable to trap Him in His words before the people; and amazed at His answer, they fell silent.
- **Luke 20:27**
Then some of the Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection, came to question Him.
- **Luke 20:28**
“Teacher,” they said, “Moses wrote for us that if a man’s brother dies and leaves a wife but no children, the man is to marry his brother’s widow and raise up offspring for him.
- **Luke 20:29**
Now there were seven brothers. The first one married a wife, but died childless.
- **Luke 20:30**
Then the second
- **Luke 20:31**
and the third married the widow, and in the same way all seven died, leaving no children.
- **Luke 20:32**
And last of all, the woman died.
- **Luke 20:33**
So then, in the resurrection, whose wife will she be? For all seven were married to her.”
- **Luke 20:34**
Jesus answered, “The sons of this age marry and are given in marriage.
- **Luke 20:35**
But those who are considered worthy to share in the age to come and in the resurrection from the dead will neither marry nor be given in marriage.
- **Luke 20:36**
In fact, they can no longer die, because they are like the angels. And since they are sons of the resurrection, they are sons of God.
- **Luke 20:37**
Even Moses demonstrates that the dead are raised, in the passage about the burning bush. For he calls the Lord ‘the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.’
- **Luke 20:38**
He is not the God of the dead, but of the living, for to Him all are alive.”
- **Luke 20:39**
Some of the scribes answered, “Teacher, You have spoken well!”
- **Luke 20:40**
And they did not dare to question Him any further.
- **Luke 20:41**
Then Jesus declared, “How can it be said that the Christ is the Son of David?
- **Luke 20:42**
For David himself says in the book of Psalms: ‘The Lord said to my Lord, “Sit at My right hand
- **Luke 20:43**
until I make Your enemies a footstool for Your feet.”’
- **Luke 20:44**
Thus David calls Him ‘Lord.’ So how can He be David’s son?”
- **Luke 20:45**
In the hearing of all the people, Jesus said to His disciples,
- **Luke 20:46**
“Beware of the scribes. They like to walk around in long robes, and they love the greetings in the marketplaces, the chief seats in the synagogues, and the places of honor at banquets.
- **Luke 20:47**
They defraud widows of their houses, and for a show make lengthy prayers. These men will receive greater condemnation.”
- **Luke 21:1**
Then Jesus looked up and saw the rich putting their gifts into the treasury,
- **Luke 21:2**
and He saw a poor widow put in two small copper coins.
- **Luke 21:3**
“Truly I tell you,” He said, “this poor widow has put in more than all the others.
- **Luke 21:4**
For they all contributed out of their surplus, but she out of her poverty has put in all she had to live on.”
- **Luke 21:5**
As some of the disciples were remarking how the temple was adorned with beautiful stones and consecrated gifts, Jesus said,
- **Luke 21:6**
“As for what you see here, the time will come when not one stone will be left on another; every one will be thrown down.”
- **Luke 21:7**
“Teacher,” they asked, “when will these things happen? And what will be the sign that they are about to take place?”
- **Luke 21:8**
Jesus answered, “See to it that you are not deceived. For many will come in My name, claiming, ‘I am He,’ and, ‘The time is near.’ Do not follow them.
- **Luke 21:9**
When you hear of wars and rebellions, do not be alarmed. These things must happen first, but the end is not imminent.”
- **Luke 21:10**
Then He told them, “Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom.
- **Luke 21:11**
There will be great earthquakes, famines, and pestilences in various places, along with fearful sights and great signs from heaven.
- **Luke 21:12**
But before all this, they will seize you and persecute you. On account of My name they will deliver you to the synagogues and prisons, and they will bring you before kings and governors.
- **Luke 21:13**
This will be your opportunity to serve as witnesses.
- **Luke 21:14**
So make up your mind not to worry beforehand how to defend yourselves.
- **Luke 21:15**
For I will give you speech and wisdom that none of your adversaries will be able to resist or contradict.
- **Luke 21:16**
You will be betrayed even by parents and brothers and relatives and friends, and some of you will be put to death.
- **Luke 21:17**
And you will be hated by everyone because of My name.
- **Luke 21:18**
Yet not even a hair of your head will perish.
- **Luke 21:19**
By your patient endurance you will gain your souls.
- **Luke 21:20**
But when you see Jerusalem surrounded by armies, you will know that her desolation is near.
- **Luke 21:21**
Then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains, let those in the city get out, and let those in the country stay out of the city.
- **Luke 21:22**
For these are the days of vengeance, to fulfill all that is written.
- **Luke 21:23**
How miserable those days will be for pregnant and nursing mothers! For there will be great distress upon the land and wrath against this people.
- **Luke 21:24**
They will fall by the edge of the sword and be led captive into all the nations. And Jerusalem will be trodden down by the Gentiles, until the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled.
- **Luke 21:25**
There will be signs in the sun and moon and stars, and on the earth dismay among the nations, bewildered by the roaring of the sea and the surging of the waves.
- **Luke 21:26**
Men will faint from fear and anxiety over what is coming upon the earth, for the powers of the heavens will be shaken.
- **Luke 21:27**
At that time they will see the Son of Man coming in a cloud with power and great glory.
- **Luke 21:28**
When these things begin to happen, stand up and lift up your heads, because your redemption is drawing near.”
- **Luke 21:29**
Then Jesus told them a parable: “Look at the fig tree and all the trees.
- **Luke 21:30**
When they sprout leaves, you can see for yourselves and know that summer is near.
- **Luke 21:31**
So also, when you see these things happening, know that the kingdom of God is near.
- **Luke 21:32**
Truly I tell you, this generation will not pass away until all these things have happened.
- **Luke 21:33**
Heaven and earth will pass away, but My words will never pass away.
- **Luke 21:34**
But watch yourselves, or your hearts will be weighed down by dissipation, drunkenness, and the worries of life—and that day will spring upon you suddenly like a snare.
- **Luke 21:35**
For it will come upon all who dwell on the face of all the earth.
- **Luke 21:36**
So keep watch at all times, and pray that you may have the strength to escape all that is about to happen and to stand before the Son of Man.”
- **Luke 21:37**
Every day Jesus taught at the temple, but every evening He went out to spend the night on the Mount of Olives.
- **Luke 21:38**
And early in the morning all the people would come to hear Him at the temple.
- **Luke 22:1**
Now the Feast of Unleavened Bread, called the Passover, was approaching,
- **Luke 22:2**
and the chief priests and scribes were looking for a way to put Jesus to death; for they feared the people.
- **Luke 22:3**
Then Satan entered Judas Iscariot, who was one of the Twelve.
- **Luke 22:4**
And Judas went to discuss with the chief priests and temple officers how he might betray Jesus to them.
- **Luke 22:5**
They were delighted and agreed to give him money.
- **Luke 22:6**
Judas consented, and began to look for an opportunity to betray Jesus to them in the absence of a crowd.
- **Luke 22:7**
Then came the day of Unleavened Bread on which the Passover lamb was to be sacrificed.
- **Luke 22:8**
Jesus sent Peter and John, saying, “Go and prepare for us to eat the Passover.”
- **Luke 22:9**
“Where do You want us to prepare it?” they asked.
- **Luke 22:10**
He answered, “When you enter the city, a man carrying a jug of water will meet you. Follow him to the house he enters,
- **Luke 22:11**
and say to the owner of that house, ‘The Teacher asks: Where is the guest room, where I may eat the Passover with My disciples?’
- **Luke 22:12**
And he will show you a large upper room, already furnished. Make preparations there.”
- **Luke 22:13**
So they went and found it just as Jesus had told them. And they prepared the Passover.
- **Luke 22:14**
When the hour had come, Jesus reclined at the table with His apostles.
- **Luke 22:15**
And He said to them, “I have eagerly desired to eat this Passover with you before My suffering.
- **Luke 22:16**
For I tell you that I will not eat it again until it is fulfilled in the kingdom of God.”
- **Luke 22:17**
After taking the cup, He gave thanks and said, “Take this and divide it among yourselves.
- **Luke 22:18**
For I tell you that I will not drink of the fruit of the vine from now on until the kingdom of God comes.”
- **Luke 22:19**
And He took the bread, gave thanks and broke it, and gave it to them, saying, “This is My body, given for you; do this in remembrance of Me.”
- **Luke 22:20**
In the same way, after supper He took the cup, saying, “This cup is the new covenant in My blood, which is poured out for you.
- **Luke 22:21**
Look! The hand of My betrayer is with Mine on the table.
- **Luke 22:22**
Indeed, the Son of Man will go as it has been determined, but woe to that man who betrays Him.”
- **Luke 22:23**
Then they began to question among themselves which of them was going to do this.
- **Luke 22:24**
A dispute also arose among the disciples as to which of them would be considered the greatest.
- **Luke 22:25**
So Jesus declared, “The kings of the Gentiles lord it over them, and those in authority over them call themselves benefactors.
- **Luke 22:26**
But you shall not be like them. Instead, the greatest among you should be like the youngest, and the one who leads like the one who serves.
- **Luke 22:27**
For who is greater, the one who reclines at the table or the one who serves? Is it not the one who reclines? But I am among you as one who serves.
- **Luke 22:28**
You are the ones who have stood by Me in My trials.
- **Luke 22:29**
And I bestow on you a kingdom, just as My Father has bestowed one on Me,
- **Luke 22:30**
so that you may eat and drink at My table in My kingdom, and sit on thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.
- **Luke 22:31**
Simon, Simon, Satan has asked to sift each of you like wheat.
- **Luke 22:32**
But I have prayed for you, Simon, that your faith will not fail. And when you have turned back, strengthen your brothers.”
- **Luke 22:33**
“Lord,” said Peter, “I am ready to go with You even to prison and to death.”
- **Luke 22:34**
But Jesus replied, “I tell you, Peter, the rooster will not crow today until you have denied three times that you know Me.”
- **Luke 22:35**
Then Jesus asked them, “When I sent you out without purse or bag or sandals, did you lack anything?” “Nothing,” they answered.
- **Luke 22:36**
“Now, however,” He told them, “the one with a purse should take it, and likewise a bag; and the one without a sword should sell his cloak and buy one.
- **Luke 22:37**
For I tell you that this Scripture must be fulfilled in Me: ‘And He was numbered with the transgressors.’ For what is written about Me is reaching its fulfillment.”
- **Luke 22:38**
So they said, “Look, Lord, here are two swords.” “That is enough,” He answered.
- **Luke 22:39**
Jesus went out as usual to the Mount of Olives, and the disciples followed Him.
- **Luke 22:40**
When He came to the place, He told them, “Pray that you will not enter into temptation.”
- **Luke 22:41**
And He withdrew about a stone’s throw beyond them, where He knelt down and prayed,
- **Luke 22:42**
“Father, if You are willing, take this cup from Me. Yet not My will, but Yours be done.”
- **Luke 22:43**
Then an angel from heaven appeared to Him and strengthened Him.
- **Luke 22:44**
And in His anguish, He prayed more earnestly, and His sweat became like drops of blood falling to the ground.
- **Luke 22:45**
When Jesus rose from prayer and returned to the disciples, He found them asleep, exhausted from sorrow.
- **Luke 22:46**
“Why are you sleeping?” He asked. “Get up and pray so that you will not enter into temptation.”
- **Luke 22:47**
While He was still speaking, a crowd arrived, led by the man called Judas, one of the Twelve. He approached Jesus to kiss Him.
- **Luke 22:48**
But Jesus asked him, “Judas, are you betraying the Son of Man with a kiss?”
- **Luke 22:49**
Those around Jesus saw what was about to happen and said, “Lord, should we strike with our swords?”
- **Luke 22:50**
And one of them struck the servant of the high priest, cutting off his right ear.
- **Luke 22:51**
But Jesus answered, “No more of this!” And He touched the man’s ear and healed him.
- **Luke 22:52**
Then Jesus said to the chief priests, temple officers, and elders who had come for Him, “Have you come out with swords and clubs as you would against an outlaw?
- **Luke 22:53**
Every day I was with you in the temple courts, and you did not lay a hand on Me. But this hour belongs to you and to the power of darkness.”
- **Luke 22:54**
Then they seized Jesus, led Him away, and took Him into the house of the high priest. And Peter followed at a distance.
- **Luke 22:55**
When those present had kindled a fire in the middle of the courtyard and sat down together, Peter sat down among them.
- **Luke 22:56**
A servant girl saw him seated in the firelight and looked intently at him. “This man also was with Him,” she said.
- **Luke 22:57**
But Peter denied it. “Woman, I do not know Him,” he said.
- **Luke 22:58**
A short time later, someone else saw him and said, “You also are one of them.” But Peter said, “Man, I am not.”
- **Luke 22:59**
About an hour later, another man insisted, “Certainly this man was with Him, for he too is a Galilean.”
- **Luke 22:60**
“Man, I do not know what you are talking about,” Peter replied. While he was still speaking, the rooster crowed.
- **Luke 22:61**
And the Lord turned and looked at Peter. Then Peter remembered the word that the Lord had spoken to him: “Before the rooster crows today, you will deny Me three times.”
- **Luke 22:62**
And he went outside and wept bitterly.
- **Luke 22:63**
The men who were holding Jesus began to mock Him and beat Him.
- **Luke 22:64**
They blindfolded Him and kept demanding, “Prophesy! Who hit You?”
- **Luke 22:65**
And they said many other blasphemous things against Him.
- **Luke 22:66**
At daybreak the council of the elders of the people, both the chief priests and scribes, met together. They led Jesus into their Sanhedrin and said,
- **Luke 22:67**
“If You are the Christ, tell us.” Jesus answered, “If I tell you, you will not believe.
- **Luke 22:68**
And if I ask you a question, you will not answer.
- **Luke 22:69**
But from now on the Son of Man will be seated at the right hand of the power of God.”
- **Luke 22:70**
So they all asked, “Are You then the Son of God?” He replied, “You say that I am.”
- **Luke 22:71**
“Why do we need any more testimony?” they declared. “We have heard it for ourselves from His own lips.”
- **Luke 23:1**
Then the whole council rose and led Jesus away to Pilate.
- **Luke 23:2**
And they began to accuse Him, saying, “We found this man subverting our nation, forbidding payment of taxes to Caesar, and proclaiming Himself to be Christ, a King.”
- **Luke 23:3**
So Pilate asked Him, “Are You the King of the Jews?” “You have said so,” Jesus replied.
- **Luke 23:4**
Then Pilate said to the chief priests and the crowds, “I find no basis for a charge against this man.”
- **Luke 23:5**
But they kept insisting, “He stirs up the people all over Judea with His teaching. He began in Galilee and has come all the way here.”
- **Luke 23:6**
When Pilate heard this, he asked if the man was a Galilean.
- **Luke 23:7**
And learning that Jesus was under Herod’s jurisdiction, he sent Him to Herod, who himself was in Jerusalem at that time.
- **Luke 23:8**
When Herod saw Jesus, he was greatly pleased. He had wanted to see Him for a long time, because he had heard about Him and was hoping to see Him perform a miracle.
- **Luke 23:9**
Herod questioned Jesus at great length, but He gave no answer.
- **Luke 23:10**
Meanwhile, the chief priests and scribes stood there, vehemently accusing Him.
- **Luke 23:11**
And even Herod and his soldiers ridiculed and mocked Him. Dressing Him in a fine robe, they sent Him back to Pilate.
- **Luke 23:12**
That day Herod and Pilate became friends; before this time they had been enemies.
- **Luke 23:13**
Then Pilate called together the chief priests, the rulers, and the people,
- **Luke 23:14**
and said to them, “You brought me this man as one who was inciting the people to rebellion. I have examined Him here in your presence and found Him not guilty of your charges against Him.
- **Luke 23:15**
Neither has Herod, for he sent Him back to us. As you can see, He has done nothing deserving of death.
- **Luke 23:16**
Therefore I will punish Him and release Him.”
- **Luke 23:17**

- **Luke 23:18**
But they all cried out in unison: “Away with this man! Release Barabbas to us!”
- **Luke 23:19**
(Barabbas had been imprisoned for an insurrection in the city, and for murder.)
- **Luke 23:20**
Wanting to release Jesus, Pilate addressed them again,
- **Luke 23:21**
but they kept shouting, “Crucify Him! Crucify Him!”
- **Luke 23:22**
A third time he said to them, “What evil has this man done? I have found in Him no offense worthy of death. So after I punish Him, I will release Him.”
- **Luke 23:23**
But they were insistent, demanding with loud voices for Jesus to be crucified. And their clamor prevailed.
- **Luke 23:24**
So Pilate sentenced that their demand be met.
- **Luke 23:25**
As they had requested, he released the one imprisoned for insurrection and murder, and handed Jesus over to their will.
- **Luke 23:26**
As the soldiers led Him away, they seized Simon of Cyrene on his way in from the country, and put the cross on him to carry behind Jesus.
- **Luke 23:27**
A great number of people followed Him, including women who kept mourning and wailing for Him.
- **Luke 23:28**
But Jesus turned to them and said, “Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep for Me, but weep for yourselves and for your children.
- **Luke 23:29**
Look, the days are coming when people will say, ‘Blessed are the barren women, the wombs that never bore, and breasts that never nursed!’
- **Luke 23:30**
At that time ‘they will say to the mountains, “Fall on us!” and to the hills, “Cover us!”’
- **Luke 23:31**
For if men do these things while the tree is green, what will happen when it is dry?”
- **Luke 23:32**
Two others, who were criminals, were also led away to be executed with Jesus.
- **Luke 23:33**
When they came to the place called The Skull, they crucified Him there, along with the criminals, one on His right and the other on His left.
- **Luke 23:34**
Then Jesus said, “Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing.” And they divided up His garments by casting lots.
- **Luke 23:35**
The people stood watching, and the rulers sneered at Him, saying, “He saved others; let Him save Himself if He is the Christ of God, the Chosen One.”
- **Luke 23:36**
The soldiers also mocked Him and came up to offer Him sour wine.
- **Luke 23:37**
“If You are the King of the Jews,” they said, “save Yourself!”
- **Luke 23:38**
Above Him was posted an inscription: THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.
- **Luke 23:39**
One of the criminals who hung there heaped abuse on Him. “Are You not the Christ?” he said. “Save Yourself and us!”
- **Luke 23:40**
But the other one rebuked him, saying, “Do you not even fear God, since you are under the same judgment?
- **Luke 23:41**
We are punished justly, for we are receiving what our actions deserve. But this man has done nothing wrong.”
- **Luke 23:42**
Then he said, “Jesus, remember me when You come into Your kingdom!”
- **Luke 23:43**
And Jesus said to him, “Truly I tell you, today you will be with Me in Paradise.”
- **Luke 23:44**
It was now about the sixth hour, and darkness came over all the land until the ninth hour.
- **Luke 23:45**
The sun was darkened, and the veil of the temple was torn down the middle.
- **Luke 23:46**
Then Jesus called out in a loud voice, “Father, into Your hands I commit My Spirit.” And when He had said this, He breathed His last.
- **Luke 23:47**
When the centurion saw what had happened, he gave glory to God, saying, “Surely this was a righteous man.”
- **Luke 23:48**
And when all the people who had gathered for this spectacle saw what had happened, they returned home beating their breasts.
- **Luke 23:49**
But all those who knew Jesus, including the women who had followed Him from Galilee, stood at a distance watching these things.
- **Luke 23:50**
Now there was a Council member named Joseph, a good and righteous man,
- **Luke 23:51**
who had not consented to their decision or action. He was from the Judean town of Arimathea, and was waiting for the kingdom of God.
- **Luke 23:52**
He went to Pilate to ask for the body of Jesus.
- **Luke 23:53**
Then he took it down, wrapped it in a linen cloth, and placed it in a tomb cut into the rock, where no one had yet been laid.
- **Luke 23:54**
It was Preparation Day, and the Sabbath was beginning.
- **Luke 23:55**
The women who had come with Jesus from Galilee followed, and they saw the tomb and how His body was placed.
- **Luke 23:56**
Then they returned to prepare spices and perfumes. And they rested on the Sabbath, according to the commandment.
- **Luke 24:1**
On the first day of the week, very early in the morning, the women came to the tomb, bringing the spices they had prepared.
- **Luke 24:2**
They found the stone rolled away from the tomb,
- **Luke 24:3**
but when they entered, they did not find the body of the Lord Jesus.
- **Luke 24:4**
While they were puzzling over this, suddenly two men in radiant apparel stood beside them.
- **Luke 24:5**
As the women bowed their faces to the ground in terror, the two men asked them, “Why do you look for the living among the dead?
- **Luke 24:6**
He is not here; He has risen! Remember how He told you while He was still in Galilee:
- **Luke 24:7**
‘The Son of Man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and on the third day rise again.’”
- **Luke 24:8**
Then they remembered His words.
- **Luke 24:9**
And when they returned from the tomb, they reported all these things to the Eleven and to all the others.
- **Luke 24:10**
It was Mary Magdalene, Joanna, Mary the mother of James, and the other women with them who told this to the apostles.
- **Luke 24:11**
But their words seemed like nonsense to them, and they did not believe the women.
- **Luke 24:12**
Peter, however, got up and ran to the tomb. And after bending down and seeing only the linen cloths, he went away, wondering to himself what had happened.
- **Luke 24:13**
That same day two of them were going to a village called Emmaus, about seven miles from Jerusalem.
- **Luke 24:14**
They were talking with each other about everything that had happened.
- **Luke 24:15**
And as they talked and deliberated, Jesus Himself came up and walked along with them.
- **Luke 24:16**
But their eyes were kept from recognizing Him.
- **Luke 24:17**
He asked them, “What are you discussing so intently as you walk along?” They stood still, with sadness on their faces.
- **Luke 24:18**
One of them, named Cleopas, asked Him, “Are You the only visitor to Jerusalem who does not know the things that have happened there in recent days?”
- **Luke 24:19**
“What things?” He asked. “The events involving Jesus of Nazareth,” they answered. “This man was a prophet, powerful in speech and action before God and all the people.
- **Luke 24:20**
Our chief priests and rulers delivered Him up to the sentence of death, and they crucified Him.
- **Luke 24:21**
But we were hoping He was the One who would redeem Israel. And besides all this, it is the third day since these things took place.
- **Luke 24:22**
Furthermore, some of our women astounded us. They were at the tomb early this morning,
- **Luke 24:23**
but they did not find His body. They came and told us they had seen a vision of angels, who said that Jesus was alive.
- **Luke 24:24**
Then some of our companions went to the tomb and found it just as the women had described. But Him they did not see.”
- **Luke 24:25**
Then Jesus said to them, “O foolish ones, how slow are your hearts to believe all that the prophets have spoken!
- **Luke 24:26**
Was it not necessary for the Christ to suffer these things and then to enter His glory?”
- **Luke 24:27**
And beginning with Moses and all the Prophets, He explained to them what was written in all the Scriptures about Himself.
- **Luke 24:28**
As they approached the village where they were headed, He seemed to be going farther.
- **Luke 24:29**
But they pleaded with Him, “Stay with us, for it is nearly evening and the day is almost over.” So He went in to stay with them.
- **Luke 24:30**
While He was reclining at the table with them, He took bread, spoke a blessing and broke it, and gave it to them.
- **Luke 24:31**
Then their eyes were opened and they recognized Jesus—and He disappeared from their sight.
- **Luke 24:32**
They asked each other, “Were not our hearts burning within us as He spoke with us on the road and opened the Scriptures to us?”
- **Luke 24:33**
And they got up that very hour and returned to Jerusalem. There they found the Eleven and those with them, gathered together
- **Luke 24:34**
and saying, “The Lord has indeed risen and has appeared to Simon!”
- **Luke 24:35**
Then the two told what had happened on the road, and how they had recognized Jesus in the breaking of the bread.
- **Luke 24:36**
While they were describing these events, Jesus Himself stood among them and said, “Peace be with you.”
- **Luke 24:37**
But they were startled and frightened, thinking they had seen a spirit.
- **Luke 24:38**
“Why are you troubled,” Jesus asked, “and why do doubts arise in your hearts?
- **Luke 24:39**
Look at My hands and My feet. It is I Myself. Touch Me and see—for a spirit does not have flesh and bones, as you see I have.”
- **Luke 24:40**
And when He had said this, He showed them His hands and feet.
- **Luke 24:41**
While they were still in disbelief because of their joy and amazement, He asked them, “Do you have anything here to eat?”
- **Luke 24:42**
So they gave Him a piece of broiled fish,
- **Luke 24:43**
and He took it and ate it in front of them.
- **Luke 24:44**
Jesus said to them, “These are the words I spoke to you while I was still with you: Everything must be fulfilled that is written about Me in the Law of Moses, the Prophets, and the Psalms.”
- **Luke 24:45**
Then He opened their minds to understand the Scriptures.
- **Luke 24:46**
And He told them, “This is what is written: The Christ will suffer and rise from the dead on the third day,
- **Luke 24:47**
and in His name repentance and forgiveness of sins will be proclaimed to all nations, beginning in Jerusalem.
- **Luke 24:48**
You are witnesses of these things.
- **Luke 24:49**
And behold, I am sending the promise of My Father upon you. But remain in the city until you have been clothed with power from on high.”
- **Luke 24:50**
When Jesus had led them out as far as Bethany, He lifted up His hands and blessed them.
- **Luke 24:51**
While He was blessing them, He left them and was carried up into heaven.
- **Luke 24:52**
And they worshiped Him and returned to Jerusalem with great joy,
- **Luke 24:53**
praising God continually in the temple.
