title:: Holy Bible/Job

- **Job 1:1**
There was a man in the land of Uz whose name was Job. And this man was blameless and upright, fearing God and shunning evil.
- **Job 1:2**
He had seven sons and three daughters,
- **Job 1:3**
and he owned 7,000 sheep, 3,000 camels, 500 yoke of oxen, 500 female donkeys, and a very large number of servants. Job was the greatest man of all the people of the East.
- **Job 1:4**
Job’s sons would take turns holding feasts in their homes, and they would invite their three sisters to eat and drink with them.
- **Job 1:5**
And when the days of feasting were over, Job would send for his children to purify them, rising early in the morning to offer burnt offerings for all of them. For Job thought, “Perhaps my children have sinned and cursed God in their hearts.” This was Job’s regular practice.
- **Job 1:6**
One day the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan also came with them.
- **Job 1:7**
“Where have you come from?” said the LORD to Satan. “From roaming through the earth,” he replied, “and walking back and forth in it.”
- **Job 1:8**
Then the LORD said to Satan, “Have you considered My servant Job? For there is no one on earth like him, a man who is blameless and upright, who fears God and shuns evil.”
- **Job 1:9**
Satan answered the LORD, “Does Job fear God for nothing?
- **Job 1:10**
Have You not placed a hedge on every side around him and his household and all that he owns? You have blessed the work of his hands, and his possessions have increased in the land.
- **Job 1:11**
But stretch out Your hand and strike all that he has, and he will surely curse You to Your face.”
- **Job 1:12**
“Very well,” said the LORD to Satan. “Everything he has is in your hands, but you must not lay a hand on the man himself.” Then Satan went out from the presence of the LORD.
- **Job 1:13**
One day, while Job’s sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine in their oldest brother’s house,
- **Job 1:14**
a messenger came and reported to Job: “While the oxen were plowing and the donkeys were grazing nearby,
- **Job 1:15**
the Sabeans swooped down and took them away. They put the servants to the sword, and I alone have escaped to tell you!”
- **Job 1:16**
While he was still speaking, another messenger came and reported: “The fire of God fell from heaven. It burned and consumed the sheep and the servants, and I alone have escaped to tell you!”
- **Job 1:17**
While he was still speaking, another messenger came and reported: “The Chaldeans formed three bands, raided the camels, and took them away. They put the servants to the sword, and I alone have escaped to tell you!”
- **Job 1:18**
While he was still speaking, another messenger came and reported: “Your sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine in their oldest brother’s house,
- **Job 1:19**
when suddenly a mighty wind swept in from the desert and struck the four corners of the house. It collapsed on the young people and they are dead, and I alone have escaped to tell you!”
- **Job 1:20**
Then Job stood up, tore his robe, and shaved his head. He fell to the ground and worshiped,
- **Job 1:21**
saying: “Naked I came from my mother’s womb, and naked I will return. The LORD gave, and the LORD has taken away. Blessed be the name of the LORD.”
- **Job 1:22**
In all this, Job did not sin or charge God with wrongdoing.
- **Job 2:1**
On another day the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan also came with them to present himself before Him.
- **Job 2:2**
“Where have you come from?” said the LORD to Satan. “From roaming through the earth,” he replied, “and walking back and forth in it.”
- **Job 2:3**
Then the LORD said to Satan, “Have you considered My servant Job? For there is no one on earth like him, a man who is blameless and upright, who fears God and shuns evil. He still retains his integrity, even though you incited Me against him to ruin him without cause.”
- **Job 2:4**
“Skin for skin!” Satan replied. “A man will give up all he owns in exchange for his life.
- **Job 2:5**
But stretch out Your hand and strike his flesh and bones, and he will surely curse You to Your face.”
- **Job 2:6**
“Very well,” said the LORD to Satan. “He is in your hands, but you must spare his life.”
- **Job 2:7**
So Satan went out from the presence of the LORD and infected Job with terrible boils from the soles of his feet to the crown of his head.
- **Job 2:8**
And Job took a piece of broken pottery to scrape himself as he sat among the ashes.
- **Job 2:9**
Then Job’s wife said to him, “Do you still retain your integrity? Curse God and die!”
- **Job 2:10**
“You speak as a foolish woman speaks,” he told her. “Should we accept from God only good and not adversity?” In all this, Job did not sin in what he said.
- **Job 2:11**
Now when Job’s three friends—Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite—heard about all this adversity that had come upon him, each of them came from his home, and they met together to go and sympathize with Job and comfort him.
- **Job 2:12**
When they lifted up their eyes from afar, they could barely recognize Job. They began to weep aloud, and each man tore his robe and threw dust in the air over his head.
- **Job 2:13**
Then they sat on the ground with him for seven days and seven nights, but no one spoke a word to him because they saw how intense his suffering was.
- **Job 3:1**
After this, Job opened his mouth and cursed the day of his birth.
- **Job 3:2**
And this is what he said:
- **Job 3:3**
“May the day of my birth perish, and the night it was said, ‘A boy is conceived.’
- **Job 3:4**
If only that day had turned to darkness! May God above disregard it; may no light shine upon it.
- **Job 3:5**
May darkness and gloom reclaim it, and a cloud settle over it; may the blackness of the day overwhelm it.
- **Job 3:6**
If only darkness had taken that night away! May it not appear among the days of the year; may it never be entered in any of the months.
- **Job 3:7**
Behold, may that night be barren; may no joyful voice come into it.
- **Job 3:8**
May it be cursed by those who curse the day—those prepared to rouse Leviathan.
- **Job 3:9**
May its morning stars grow dark; may it wait in vain for daylight; may it not see the breaking of dawn.
- **Job 3:10**
For that night did not shut the doors of the womb to hide the sorrow from my eyes.
- **Job 3:11**
Why did I not perish at birth; why did I not die as I came from the womb?
- **Job 3:12**
Why were there knees to receive me, and breasts that I should be nursed?
- **Job 3:13**
For now I would be lying down in peace; I would be asleep and at rest
- **Job 3:14**
with kings and counselors of the earth, who built for themselves cities now in ruins,
- **Job 3:15**
or with princes who had gold, who filled their houses with silver.
- **Job 3:16**
Or why was I not hidden like a stillborn child, like an infant who never sees daylight?
- **Job 3:17**
There the wicked cease from raging, and there the weary find rest.
- **Job 3:18**
The captives enjoy their ease; they do not hear the voice of the oppressor.
- **Job 3:19**
Both small and great are there, and the slave is freed from his master.
- **Job 3:20**
Why is light given to the miserable, and life to the bitter of soul,
- **Job 3:21**
who long for death that does not come, and search for it like hidden treasure,
- **Job 3:22**
who rejoice and greatly exult when they can find the grave?
- **Job 3:23**
Why is life given to a man whose way is hidden, whom God has hedged in?
- **Job 3:24**
I sigh when food is put before me, and my groans pour out like water.
- **Job 3:25**
For the thing I feared has overtaken me, and what I dreaded has befallen me.
- **Job 3:26**
I am not at ease or quiet; I have no rest, for trouble has come.”
- **Job 4:1**
Then Eliphaz the Temanite replied:
- **Job 4:2**
“If one ventures a word with you, will you be wearied? Yet who can keep from speaking?
- **Job 4:3**
Surely you have instructed many, and have strengthened their feeble hands.
- **Job 4:4**
Your words have steadied those who stumbled; you have braced the knees that were buckling.
- **Job 4:5**
But now trouble has come upon you, and you are weary. It strikes you, and you are dismayed.
- **Job 4:6**
Is your reverence not your confidence, and the uprightness of your ways your hope?
- **Job 4:7**
Consider now, I plead: Who, being innocent, has ever perished? Or where have the upright been destroyed?
- **Job 4:8**
As I have observed, those who plow iniquity and those who sow trouble reap the same.
- **Job 4:9**
By the breath of God they perish, and by the blast of His anger they are consumed.
- **Job 4:10**
The lion may roar, and the fierce lion may growl, yet the teeth of the young lions are broken.
- **Job 4:11**
The old lion perishes for lack of prey, and the cubs of the lioness are scattered.
- **Job 4:12**
Now a word came to me secretly; my ears caught a whisper of it.
- **Job 4:13**
In disquieting visions in the night, when deep sleep falls on men,
- **Job 4:14**
fear and trembling came over me and made all my bones shudder.
- **Job 4:15**
Then a spirit glided past my face, and the hair on my body bristled.
- **Job 4:16**
It stood still, but I could not discern its appearance; a form loomed before my eyes, and I heard a whispering voice:
- **Job 4:17**
‘Can a mortal be more righteous than God, or a man more pure than his Maker?
- **Job 4:18**
If God puts no trust in His servants, and He charges His angels with error,
- **Job 4:19**
how much more those who dwell in houses of clay, whose foundations are in the dust, who can be crushed like a moth!
- **Job 4:20**
They are smashed to pieces from dawn to dusk; unnoticed, they perish forever.
- **Job 4:21**
Are not their tent cords pulled up, so that they die without wisdom?’
- **Job 5:1**
“Call out if you please, but who will answer? To which of the holy ones will you turn?
- **Job 5:2**
For resentment kills a fool, and envy slays the simple.
- **Job 5:3**
I have seen a fool taking root, but suddenly his house was cursed.
- **Job 5:4**
His sons are far from safety, crushed in court without a defender.
- **Job 5:5**
The hungry consume his harvest, taking it even from the thorns, and the thirsty pant after his wealth.
- **Job 5:6**
For distress does not spring from the dust, and trouble does not sprout from the ground.
- **Job 5:7**
Yet man is born to trouble as surely as sparks fly upward.
- **Job 5:8**
However, if I were you, I would appeal to God and lay my cause before Him—
- **Job 5:9**
the One who does great and unsearchable things, wonders without number.
- **Job 5:10**
He gives rain to the earth and sends water upon the fields.
- **Job 5:11**
He sets the lowly on high, so that mourners are lifted to safety.
- **Job 5:12**
He thwarts the schemes of the crafty, so that their hands find no success.
- **Job 5:13**
He catches the wise in their craftiness, and sweeps away the plans of the cunning.
- **Job 5:14**
They encounter darkness by day and grope at noon as in the night.
- **Job 5:15**
He saves the needy from the sword in their mouth and from the clutches of the powerful.
- **Job 5:16**
So the poor have hope, and injustice shuts its mouth.
- **Job 5:17**
Blessed indeed is the man whom God corrects; so do not despise the discipline of the Almighty.
- **Job 5:18**
For He wounds, but He also binds; He strikes, but His hands also heal.
- **Job 5:19**
He will rescue you from six calamities; no harm will touch you in seven.
- **Job 5:20**
In famine He will redeem you from death, and in battle from the stroke of the sword.
- **Job 5:21**
You will be hidden from the scourge of the tongue, and will not fear havoc when it comes.
- **Job 5:22**
You will laugh at destruction and famine, and need not fear the beasts of the earth.
- **Job 5:23**
For you will have a covenant with the stones of the field, and the wild animals will be at peace with you.
- **Job 5:24**
You will know that your tent is secure, and find nothing amiss when inspecting your home.
- **Job 5:25**
You will know that your offspring will be many, your descendants like the grass of the earth.
- **Job 5:26**
You will come to the grave in full vigor, like a sheaf of grain gathered in season.
- **Job 5:27**
Indeed, we have investigated, and it is true! So hear it and know for yourself.”
- **Job 6:1**
Then Job replied:
- **Job 6:2**
“If only my grief could be weighed and placed with my calamity on the scales.
- **Job 6:3**
For then it would outweigh the sand of the seas—no wonder my words have been rash.
- **Job 6:4**
For the arrows of the Almighty have pierced me; my spirit drinks in their poison; the terrors of God are arrayed against me.
- **Job 6:5**
Does a wild donkey bray over fresh grass, or an ox low over its fodder?
- **Job 6:6**
Is tasteless food eaten without salt, or is there flavor in the white of an egg?
- **Job 6:7**
My soul refuses to touch them; they are loathsome food to me.
- **Job 6:8**
If only my request were granted and God would fulfill my hope:
- **Job 6:9**
that God would be willing to crush me, to unleash His hand and cut me off!
- **Job 6:10**
It still brings me comfort, and joy through unrelenting pain, that I have not denied the words of the Holy One.
- **Job 6:11**
What strength do I have, that I should still hope? What is my future, that I should be patient?
- **Job 6:12**
Is my strength like that of stone, or my flesh made of bronze?
- **Job 6:13**
Is there any help within me now that success is driven from me?
- **Job 6:14**
A despairing man should have the kindness of his friend, even if he forsakes the fear of the Almighty.
- **Job 6:15**
But my brothers are as faithless as wadis, as seasonal streams that overflow,
- **Job 6:16**
darkened because of the ice and the inflow of melting snow,
- **Job 6:17**
but ceasing in the dry season and vanishing from their channels in the heat.
- **Job 6:18**
Caravans turn aside from their routes; they go into the wasteland and perish.
- **Job 6:19**
The caravans of Tema look for water; the travelers of Sheba hope to find it.
- **Job 6:20**
They are confounded because they had hoped; their arrival brings disappointment.
- **Job 6:21**
For now you are of no help; you see terror, and you are afraid.
- **Job 6:22**
Have I ever said, ‘Give me something; offer me a bribe from your wealth;
- **Job 6:23**
deliver me from the hand of the enemy; redeem me from the grasp of the ruthless’?
- **Job 6:24**
Teach me, and I will be silent. Help me understand how I have erred.
- **Job 6:25**
How painful are honest words! But what does your argument prove?
- **Job 6:26**
Do you intend to correct my words, and treat as wind my cry of despair?
- **Job 6:27**
You would even cast lots for an orphan and barter away your friend.
- **Job 6:28**
But now, please look at me. Would I lie to your face?
- **Job 6:29**
Reconsider; do not be unjust. Reconsider, for my righteousness is at stake.
- **Job 6:30**
Is there iniquity on my tongue? Can my mouth not discern malice?
- **Job 7:1**
“Is not man consigned to labor on earth? Are not his days like those of a hired hand?
- **Job 7:2**
Like a slave he longs for shade; like a hireling he waits for his wages.
- **Job 7:3**
So I am allotted months of futility, and nights of misery are appointed me.
- **Job 7:4**
When I lie down I think: ‘When will I get up?’ But the night drags on, and I toss and turn until dawn.
- **Job 7:5**
My flesh is clothed with worms and encrusted with dirt; my skin is cracked and festering.
- **Job 7:6**
My days are swifter than a weaver’s shuttle; they come to an end without hope.
- **Job 7:7**
Remember that my life is but a breath. My eyes will never again see happiness.
- **Job 7:8**
The eye that beholds me will no longer see me. You will look for me, but I will be no more.
- **Job 7:9**
As a cloud vanishes and is gone, so he who goes down to Sheol does not come back up.
- **Job 7:10**
He never returns to his house; his place remembers him no more.
- **Job 7:11**
Therefore I will not restrain my mouth; I will speak in the anguish of my spirit; I will complain in the bitterness of my soul.
- **Job 7:12**
Am I the sea, or the monster of the deep, that You must keep me under guard?
- **Job 7:13**
When I think my bed will comfort me and my couch will ease my complaint,
- **Job 7:14**
then You frighten me with dreams and terrify me with visions,
- **Job 7:15**
so that I would prefer strangling and death over my life in this body.
- **Job 7:16**
I loathe my life! I would not live forever. Leave me alone, for my days are but a breath.
- **Job 7:17**
What is man that You should exalt him, that You should set Your heart upon him,
- **Job 7:18**
that You attend to him every morning, and test him every moment?
- **Job 7:19**
Will You never look away from me, or leave me alone to swallow my spittle?
- **Job 7:20**
If I have sinned, what have I done to You, O watcher of mankind? Why have You made me Your target, so that I am a burden to You?
- **Job 7:21**
Why do You not pardon my transgression and take away my iniquity? For soon I will lie down in the dust; You will seek me, but I will be no more.”
- **Job 8:1**
Then Bildad the Shuhite replied:
- **Job 8:2**
“How long will you go on saying such things? The words of your mouth are a blustering wind.
- **Job 8:3**
Does God pervert justice? Does the Almighty pervert what is right?
- **Job 8:4**
When your children sinned against Him, He gave them over to their rebellion.
- **Job 8:5**
But if you would earnestly seek God and ask the Almighty for mercy,
- **Job 8:6**
if you are pure and upright, even now He will rouse Himself on your behalf and restore your righteous estate.
- **Job 8:7**
Though your beginnings were modest, your latter days will flourish.
- **Job 8:8**
Please inquire of past generations and consider the discoveries of their fathers.
- **Job 8:9**
For we were born yesterday and know nothing; our days on earth are but a shadow.
- **Job 8:10**
Will they not teach you and tell you, and speak from their understanding?
- **Job 8:11**
Does papyrus grow where there is no marsh? Do reeds flourish without water?
- **Job 8:12**
While the shoots are still uncut, they dry up quicker than grass.
- **Job 8:13**
Such is the destiny of all who forget God; so the hope of the godless will perish.
- **Job 8:14**
His confidence is fragile; his security is in a spider’s web.
- **Job 8:15**
He leans on his web, but it gives way; he holds fast, but it does not endure.
- **Job 8:16**
He is a well-watered plant in the sunshine, spreading its shoots over the garden.
- **Job 8:17**
His roots wrap around the rock heap; he looks for a home among the stones.
- **Job 8:18**
If he is uprooted from his place, it will disown him, saying, ‘I never saw you.’
- **Job 8:19**
Surely this is the joy of his way; yet others will spring from the dust.
- **Job 8:20**
Behold, God does not reject the blameless, nor will He strengthen the hand of evildoers.
- **Job 8:21**
He will yet fill your mouth with laughter, and your lips with a shout of joy.
- **Job 8:22**
Your enemies will be clothed in shame, and the tent of the wicked will be no more.”
- **Job 9:1**
Then Job answered:
- **Job 9:2**
“Yes, I know that it is so, but how can a mortal be righteous before God?
- **Job 9:3**
If one wished to contend with God, he could not answer Him one time out of a thousand.
- **Job 9:4**
God is wise in heart and mighty in strength. Who has resisted Him and prospered?
- **Job 9:5**
He moves mountains without their knowledge and overturns them in His anger.
- **Job 9:6**
He shakes the earth from its place, so that its foundations tremble.
- **Job 9:7**
He commands the sun not to shine; He seals off the stars.
- **Job 9:8**
He alone stretches out the heavens and treads on the waves of the sea.
- **Job 9:9**
He is the Maker of the Bear and Orion, of the Pleiades and the constellations of the south.
- **Job 9:10**
He does great things beyond searching out, and wonders without number.
- **Job 9:11**
Were He to pass by me, I would not see Him; were He to move, I would not recognize Him.
- **Job 9:12**
If He takes away, who can stop Him? Who dares to ask Him, ‘What are You doing?’
- **Job 9:13**
God does not restrain His anger; the helpers of Rahab cower beneath Him.
- **Job 9:14**
How then can I answer Him or choose my arguments against Him?
- **Job 9:15**
For even if I were right, I could not answer. I could only beg my Judge for mercy.
- **Job 9:16**
If I summoned Him and He answered me, I do not believe He would listen to my voice.
- **Job 9:17**
For He would crush me with a tempest and multiply my wounds without cause.
- **Job 9:18**
He does not let me catch my breath, but overwhelms me with bitterness.
- **Job 9:19**
If it is a matter of strength, He is indeed mighty! If it is a matter of justice, who can summon Him?
- **Job 9:20**
Even if I were righteous, my mouth would condemn me; if I were blameless, it would declare me guilty.
- **Job 9:21**
Though I am blameless, I have no concern for myself; I despise my own life.
- **Job 9:22**
It is all the same, and so I say, ‘He destroys both the blameless and the wicked.’
- **Job 9:23**
When the scourge brings sudden death, He mocks the despair of the innocent.
- **Job 9:24**
The earth is given into the hand of the wicked; He blindfolds its judges. If it is not He, then who is it?
- **Job 9:25**
My days are swifter than a runner; they flee without seeing good.
- **Job 9:26**
They sweep by like boats of papyrus, like an eagle swooping down on its prey.
- **Job 9:27**
If I were to say, ‘I will forget my complaint and change my expression and smile,’
- **Job 9:28**
I would still dread all my sufferings; I know that You will not acquit me.
- **Job 9:29**
Since I am already found guilty, why should I labor in vain?
- **Job 9:30**
If I should wash myself with snow and cleanse my hands with lye,
- **Job 9:31**
then You would plunge me into the pit, and even my own clothes would despise me.
- **Job 9:32**
For He is not a man like me, that I can answer Him, that we can take each other to court.
- **Job 9:33**
Nor is there a mediator between us, to lay his hand upon us both.
- **Job 9:34**
Let Him remove His rod from me, so that His terror will no longer frighten me.
- **Job 9:35**
Then I would speak without fear of Him. But as it is, I am on my own.
- **Job 10:1**
“I loathe my own life; I will express my complaint and speak in the bitterness of my soul.
- **Job 10:2**
I will say to God: Do not condemn me! Let me know why You prosecute me.
- **Job 10:3**
Does it please You to oppress me, to reject the work of Your hands and favor the schemes of the wicked?
- **Job 10:4**
Do You have eyes of flesh? Do You see as man sees?
- **Job 10:5**
Are Your days like those of a mortal, or Your years like those of a man,
- **Job 10:6**
that You should seek my iniquity and search out my sin—
- **Job 10:7**
though You know that I am not guilty, and there is no deliverance from Your hand?
- **Job 10:8**
Your hands shaped me and altogether formed me. Would You now turn and destroy me?
- **Job 10:9**
Please remember that You molded me like clay. Would You now return me to dust?
- **Job 10:10**
Did You not pour me out like milk, and curdle me like cheese?
- **Job 10:11**
You clothed me with skin and flesh, and knit me together with bones and sinews.
- **Job 10:12**
You have granted me life and loving devotion, and Your care has preserved my spirit.
- **Job 10:13**
Yet You concealed these things in Your heart, and I know that this was in Your mind:
- **Job 10:14**
If I sinned, You would take note, and would not acquit me of my iniquity.
- **Job 10:15**
If I am guilty, woe to me! And even if I am righteous, I cannot lift my head. I am full of shame and aware of my affliction.
- **Job 10:16**
Should I hold my head high, You would hunt me like a lion, and again display Your power against me.
- **Job 10:17**
You produce new witnesses against me and multiply Your anger toward me. Hardships assault me in wave after wave.
- **Job 10:18**
Why then did You bring me from the womb? Oh, that I had died, and no eye had seen me!
- **Job 10:19**
If only I had never come to be, but had been carried from the womb to the grave.
- **Job 10:20**
Are my days not few? Withdraw from me, that I may have a little comfort,
- **Job 10:21**
before I go—never to return—to a land of darkness and gloom,
- **Job 10:22**
to a land of utter darkness, of deep shadow and disorder, where even the light is like darkness.”
- **Job 11:1**
Then Zophar the Naamathite replied:
- **Job 11:2**
“Should this stream of words go unanswered and such a speaker be vindicated?
- **Job 11:3**
Should your babbling put others to silence? Will you scoff without rebuke?
- **Job 11:4**
You have said, ‘My doctrine is sound, and I am pure in Your sight.’
- **Job 11:5**
But if only God would speak and open His lips against you,
- **Job 11:6**
and disclose to you the secrets of wisdom, for true wisdom has two sides. Know then that God exacts from you less than your iniquity deserves.
- **Job 11:7**
Can you fathom the deep things of God or discover the limits of the Almighty?
- **Job 11:8**
They are higher than the heavens—what can you do? They are deeper than Sheol—what can you know?
- **Job 11:9**
Their measure is longer than the earth and wider than the sea.
- **Job 11:10**
If He comes along to imprison you, or convenes a court, who can stop Him?
- **Job 11:11**
Surely He knows the deceit of men. If He sees iniquity, does He not take note?
- **Job 11:12**
But a witless man can no more become wise than the colt of a wild donkey can be born a man!
- **Job 11:13**
As for you, if you direct your heart and lift up your hands to Him,
- **Job 11:14**
if you put away the iniquity in your hand, and allow no injustice to dwell in your tents,
- **Job 11:15**
then indeed you will lift up your face without shame; you will stand firm and unafraid.
- **Job 11:16**
For you will forget your misery, recalling it only as waters gone by.
- **Job 11:17**
Your life will be brighter than noonday; its darkness will be like the morning.
- **Job 11:18**
You will be secure, because there is hope, and you will look around and lie down in safety.
- **Job 11:19**
You will lie down without fear, and many will court your favor.
- **Job 11:20**
But the eyes of the wicked will fail, and escape will elude them; they will hope for their last breath.”
- **Job 12:1**
Then Job answered:
- **Job 12:2**
“Truly then you are the people with whom wisdom itself will die!
- **Job 12:3**
But I also have a mind; I am not inferior to you. Who does not know such things as these?
- **Job 12:4**
I am a laughingstock to my friends, though I called on God, and He answered. The righteous and upright man is a laughingstock.
- **Job 12:5**
The one at ease scorns misfortune as the fate of those whose feet are slipping.
- **Job 12:6**
The tents of robbers are safe, and those who provoke God are secure—those who carry their god in their hands.
- **Job 12:7**
But ask the animals, and they will instruct you; ask the birds of the air, and they will tell you.
- **Job 12:8**
Or speak to the earth, and it will teach you; let the fish of the sea inform you.
- **Job 12:9**
Which of all these does not know that the hand of the LORD has done this?
- **Job 12:10**
The life of every living thing is in His hand, as well as the breath of all mankind.
- **Job 12:11**
Does not the ear test words as the tongue tastes its food?
- **Job 12:12**
Wisdom is found with the elderly, and understanding comes with long life.
- **Job 12:13**
Wisdom and strength belong to God; counsel and understanding are His.
- **Job 12:14**
What He tears down cannot be rebuilt; the man He imprisons cannot be released.
- **Job 12:15**
If He holds back the waters, they dry up, and if He releases them, they overwhelm the land.
- **Job 12:16**
True wisdom and power belong to Him. The deceived and the deceiver are His.
- **Job 12:17**
He leads counselors away barefoot and makes fools of judges.
- **Job 12:18**
He loosens the bonds placed by kings and fastens a belt around their waists.
- **Job 12:19**
He leads priests away barefoot and overthrows the established.
- **Job 12:20**
He deprives the trusted of speech and takes away the discernment of elders.
- **Job 12:21**
He pours out contempt on nobles and disarms the mighty.
- **Job 12:22**
He reveals the deep things of darkness and brings deep shadows into light.
- **Job 12:23**
He makes nations great and destroys them; He enlarges nations, then disperses them.
- **Job 12:24**
He deprives the earth’s leaders of reason and makes them wander in a trackless wasteland.
- **Job 12:25**
They grope in the darkness without light; He makes them stagger like drunkards.
- **Job 13:1**
“Indeed, my eyes have seen all this; my ears have heard and understood.
- **Job 13:2**
What you know, I also know; I am not inferior to you.
- **Job 13:3**
Yet I desire to speak to the Almighty and argue my case before God.
- **Job 13:4**
You, however, smear with lies; you are all worthless physicians.
- **Job 13:5**
If only you would remain silent; for that would be your wisdom!
- **Job 13:6**
Hear now my argument, and listen to the plea of my lips.
- **Job 13:7**
Will you speak wickedly on God’s behalf or speak deceitfully for Him?
- **Job 13:8**
Would you show Him partiality or argue in His defense?
- **Job 13:9**
Would it be well when He examined you? Could you deceive Him like a man?
- **Job 13:10**
Surely He would rebuke you if you secretly showed partiality.
- **Job 13:11**
Would His majesty not terrify you? Would the dread of Him not fall upon you?
- **Job 13:12**
Your maxims are proverbs of ashes; your defenses are defenses of clay.
- **Job 13:13**
Be silent, and I will speak. Then let come to me what may.
- **Job 13:14**
Why do I put myself at risk and take my life in my own hands?
- **Job 13:15**
Though He slay me, I will hope in Him. I will still defend my ways to His face.
- **Job 13:16**
Moreover, this will be my salvation, for no godless man can appear before Him.
- **Job 13:17**
Listen carefully to my words; let my declaration ring in your ears.
- **Job 13:18**
Behold, now that I have prepared my case, I know that I will be vindicated.
- **Job 13:19**
Can anyone indict me? If so, I will be silent and die.
- **Job 13:20**
Only grant these two things to me, so that I need not hide from You:
- **Job 13:21**
Withdraw Your hand from me, and do not let Your terror frighten me.
- **Job 13:22**
Then call me, and I will answer, or let me speak, and You can reply.
- **Job 13:23**
How many are my iniquities and sins? Reveal to me my transgression and sin.
- **Job 13:24**
Why do You hide Your face and consider me as Your enemy?
- **Job 13:25**
Would You frighten a windblown leaf? Would You chase after dry chaff?
- **Job 13:26**
For You record bitter accusations against me and bequeath to me the iniquities of my youth.
- **Job 13:27**
You put my feet in the stocks and stand watch over all my paths; You set a limit for the soles of my feet.
- **Job 13:28**
So man wastes away like something rotten, like a moth-eaten garment.
- **Job 14:1**
“Man, who is born of woman, is short of days and full of trouble.
- **Job 14:2**
Like a flower, he comes forth, then withers away; like a fleeting shadow, he does not endure.
- **Job 14:3**
Do You open Your eyes to one like this? Will You bring him into judgment before You?
- **Job 14:4**
Who can bring out clean from unclean? No one!
- **Job 14:5**
Since his days are determined and the number of his months is with You, and since You have set limits that he cannot exceed,
- **Job 14:6**
look away from him and let him rest, so he can enjoy his day as a hired hand.
- **Job 14:7**
For there is hope for a tree: If it is cut down, it will sprout again, and its tender shoots will not fail.
- **Job 14:8**
If its roots grow old in the ground and its stump dies in the soil,
- **Job 14:9**
at the scent of water it will bud and put forth twigs like a sapling.
- **Job 14:10**
But a man dies and is laid low; he breathes his last, and where is he?
- **Job 14:11**
As water disappears from the sea and a river becomes parched and dry,
- **Job 14:12**
so a man lies down and does not rise. Until the heavens are no more, he will not be awakened or roused from sleep.
- **Job 14:13**
If only You would hide me in Sheol and conceal me until Your anger has passed! If only You would appoint a time for me and then remember me!
- **Job 14:14**
When a man dies, will he live again? All the days of my hard service I will wait, until my renewal comes.
- **Job 14:15**
You will call, and I will answer; You will desire the work of Your hands.
- **Job 14:16**
For then You would count my steps, but would not keep track of my sin.
- **Job 14:17**
My transgression would be sealed in a bag, and You would cover over my iniquity.
- **Job 14:18**
But as a mountain erodes and crumbles and a rock is dislodged from its place,
- **Job 14:19**
as water wears away the stones and torrents wash away the soil, so You destroy a man’s hope.
- **Job 14:20**
You forever overpower him, and he passes on; You change his countenance and send him away.
- **Job 14:21**
If his sons receive honor, he does not know it; if they are brought low, he is unaware.
- **Job 14:22**
He feels only the pain of his own body and mourns only for himself.”
- **Job 15:1**
Then Eliphaz the Temanite replied:
- **Job 15:2**
“Does a wise man answer with empty counsel or fill his belly with the hot east wind?
- **Job 15:3**
Should he argue with useless words or speeches that serve no purpose?
- **Job 15:4**
But you even undermine the fear of God and hinder meditation before Him.
- **Job 15:5**
For your iniquity instructs your mouth, and you choose the language of the crafty.
- **Job 15:6**
Your own mouth, not mine, condemns you; your own lips testify against you.
- **Job 15:7**
Were you the first man ever born? Were you brought forth before the hills?
- **Job 15:8**
Do you listen in on the council of God or limit wisdom to yourself?
- **Job 15:9**
What do you know that we do not? What do you understand that is not clear to us?
- **Job 15:10**
Both the gray-haired and the aged are on our side—men much older than your father.
- **Job 15:11**
Are the consolations of God not enough for you, even words spoken gently to you?
- **Job 15:12**
Why has your heart carried you away, and why do your eyes flash,
- **Job 15:13**
as you turn your spirit against God and pour such words from your mouth?
- **Job 15:14**
What is man, that he should be pure, or one born of woman, that he should be righteous?
- **Job 15:15**
If God puts no trust in His holy ones, if even the heavens are not pure in His eyes,
- **Job 15:16**
how much less man, who is vile and corrupt, who drinks injustice like water?
- **Job 15:17**
Listen to me and I will inform you. I will describe what I have seen,
- **Job 15:18**
what was declared by wise men and was not concealed from their fathers,
- **Job 15:19**
to whom alone the land was given when no foreigner passed among them.
- **Job 15:20**
A wicked man writhes in pain all his days; only a few years are reserved for the ruthless.
- **Job 15:21**
Sounds of terror fill his ears; in his prosperity the destroyer attacks him.
- **Job 15:22**
He despairs of his return from darkness; he is marked for the sword.
- **Job 15:23**
He wanders about as food for vultures; he knows the day of darkness is at hand.
- **Job 15:24**
Distress and anguish terrify him, overwhelming him like a king poised to attack.
- **Job 15:25**
For he has stretched out his hand against God and has vaunted himself against the Almighty,
- **Job 15:26**
rushing headlong at Him with a thick, studded shield.
- **Job 15:27**
Though his face is covered with fat and his waistline bulges with flesh,
- **Job 15:28**
he will dwell in ruined cities, in abandoned houses destined to become rubble.
- **Job 15:29**
He will no longer be rich; his wealth will not endure. His possessions will not overspread the land.
- **Job 15:30**
He will not escape from the darkness; the flame will wither his shoots, and the breath of God’s mouth will carry him away.
- **Job 15:31**
Let him not deceive himself with trust in emptiness, for emptiness will be his reward.
- **Job 15:32**
It will be paid in full before his time, and his branch will not flourish.
- **Job 15:33**
He will be like a vine stripped of its unripe grapes, like an olive tree that sheds its blossoms.
- **Job 15:34**
For the company of the godless will be barren, and fire will consume the tents of bribery.
- **Job 15:35**
They conceive trouble and give birth to evil; their womb is pregnant with deceit.”
- **Job 16:1**
Then Job answered:
- **Job 16:2**
“I have heard many things like these; miserable comforters are you all.
- **Job 16:3**
Is there no end to your long-winded speeches? What provokes you to continue testifying?
- **Job 16:4**
I could also speak like you if you were in my place; I could heap up words against you and shake my head at you.
- **Job 16:5**
But I would encourage you with my mouth, and the consolation of my lips would bring relief.
- **Job 16:6**
Even if I speak, my pain is not relieved, and if I hold back, how will it go away?
- **Job 16:7**
Surely He has now exhausted me; You have devastated all my family.
- **Job 16:8**
You have bound me, and it has become a witness; my frailty rises up and testifies against me.
- **Job 16:9**
His anger has torn me and opposed me; He gnashes His teeth at me. My adversary pierces me with His eyes.
- **Job 16:10**
They open their mouths against me and strike my cheeks with contempt; they join together against me.
- **Job 16:11**
God has delivered me to unjust men; He has thrown me to the clutches of the wicked.
- **Job 16:12**
I was at ease, but He shattered me; He seized me by the neck and crushed me. He has set me up as His target;
- **Job 16:13**
His archers surround me. He pierces my kidneys without mercy and spills my gall on the ground.
- **Job 16:14**
He breaks me with wound upon wound; He rushes me like a mighty warrior.
- **Job 16:15**
I have sewn sackcloth over my skin; I have buried my horn in the dust.
- **Job 16:16**
My face is red with weeping, and deep shadows ring my eyes;
- **Job 16:17**
yet my hands are free of violence and my prayer is pure.
- **Job 16:18**
O earth, do not cover my blood; may my cry for help never be laid to rest.
- **Job 16:19**
Even now my witness is in heaven, and my advocate is on high.
- **Job 16:20**
My friends are my scoffers as my eyes pour out tears to God.
- **Job 16:21**
Oh, that a man might plead with God as he pleads with his neighbor!
- **Job 16:22**
For when only a few years are past I will go the way of no return.
- **Job 17:1**
“My spirit is broken; my days are extinguished; the grave awaits me.
- **Job 17:2**
Surely mockers surround me, and my eyes must gaze at their rebellion.
- **Job 17:3**
Give me, I pray, the pledge You demand. Who else will be my guarantor?
- **Job 17:4**
You have closed their minds to understanding; therefore You will not exalt them.
- **Job 17:5**
If a man denounces his friends for a price, the eyes of his children will fail.
- **Job 17:6**
He has made me a byword among the people, a man in whose face they spit.
- **Job 17:7**
My eyes have grown dim with grief, and my whole body is but a shadow.
- **Job 17:8**
The upright are appalled at this, and the innocent are stirred against the godless.
- **Job 17:9**
Yet a righteous one holds to his way, and the one with clean hands grows stronger.
- **Job 17:10**
But come back and try again, all of you. For I will not find a wise man among you.
- **Job 17:11**
My days have passed; my plans are broken off—even the desires of my heart.
- **Job 17:12**
They have turned night into day, making light seem near in the face of darkness.
- **Job 17:13**
If I look for Sheol as my home, if I spread out my bed in darkness,
- **Job 17:14**
and say to corruption, ‘You are my father,’ and to the worm, ‘My mother,’ or ‘My sister,’
- **Job 17:15**
where then is my hope? Who can see any hope for me?
- **Job 17:16**
Will it go down to the gates of Sheol? Will we go down together into the dust?”
- **Job 18:1**
Then Bildad the Shuhite replied:
- **Job 18:2**
“How long until you end these speeches? Show some sense, and then we can talk.
- **Job 18:3**
Why are we regarded as cattle, as stupid in your sight?
- **Job 18:4**
You who tear yourself in anger—should the earth be forsaken on your account, or the rocks be moved from their place?
- **Job 18:5**
Indeed, the lamp of the wicked is extinguished; the flame of his fire does not glow.
- **Job 18:6**
The light in his tent grows dark, and the lamp beside him goes out.
- **Job 18:7**
His vigorous stride is shortened, and his own schemes trip him up.
- **Job 18:8**
For his own feet lead him into a net, and he wanders into its mesh.
- **Job 18:9**
A trap seizes his heel; a snare grips him.
- **Job 18:10**
A noose is hidden in the ground, and a trap lies in his path.
- **Job 18:11**
Terrors frighten him on every side and harass his every step.
- **Job 18:12**
His strength is depleted, and calamity is ready at his side.
- **Job 18:13**
It devours patches of his skin; the firstborn of death devours his limbs.
- **Job 18:14**
He is torn from the shelter of his tent and is marched off to the king of terrors.
- **Job 18:15**
Fire resides in his tent; burning sulfur rains down on his dwelling.
- **Job 18:16**
The roots beneath him dry up, and the branches above him wither away.
- **Job 18:17**
The memory of him perishes from the earth, and he has no name in the land.
- **Job 18:18**
He is driven from light into darkness and is chased from the inhabited world.
- **Job 18:19**
He has no offspring or posterity among his people, no survivor where he once lived.
- **Job 18:20**
Those in the west are appalled at his fate, while those in the east tremble in horror.
- **Job 18:21**
Surely such is the dwelling of the wicked and the place of one who does not know God.”
- **Job 19:1**
Then Job answered:
- **Job 19:2**
“How long will you torment me and crush me with your words?
- **Job 19:3**
Ten times now you have reproached me; you shamelessly mistreat me.
- **Job 19:4**
Even if I have truly gone astray, my error concerns me alone.
- **Job 19:5**
If indeed you would exalt yourselves above me and use my disgrace against me,
- **Job 19:6**
then understand that it is God who has wronged me and drawn His net around me.
- **Job 19:7**
Though I cry out, ‘Violence!’ I get no response; though I call for help, there is no justice.
- **Job 19:8**
He has blocked my way so I cannot pass; He has veiled my paths with darkness.
- **Job 19:9**
He has stripped me of my honor and removed the crown from my head.
- **Job 19:10**
He tears me down on every side until I am gone; He uproots my hope like a tree.
- **Job 19:11**
His anger burns against me, and He counts me among His enemies.
- **Job 19:12**
His troops advance together; they construct a ramp against me and encamp around my tent.
- **Job 19:13**
He has removed my brothers from me; my acquaintances have abandoned me.
- **Job 19:14**
My kinsmen have failed me, and my friends have forgotten me.
- **Job 19:15**
My guests and maidservants count me as a stranger; I am a foreigner in their sight.
- **Job 19:16**
I call for my servant, but he does not answer, though I implore him with my own mouth.
- **Job 19:17**
My breath is repulsive to my wife, and I am loathsome to my own family.
- **Job 19:18**
Even little boys scorn me; when I appear, they deride me.
- **Job 19:19**
All my best friends despise me, and those I love have turned against me.
- **Job 19:20**
My skin and flesh cling to my bones; I have escaped by the skin of my teeth.
- **Job 19:21**
Have pity on me, my friends, have pity, for the hand of God has struck me.
- **Job 19:22**
Why do you persecute me as God does? Will you never get enough of my flesh?
- **Job 19:23**
I wish that my words were recorded and inscribed in a book,
- **Job 19:24**
by an iron stylus on lead, or chiseled in stone forever.
- **Job 19:25**
But I know that my Redeemer lives, and in the end He will stand upon the earth.
- **Job 19:26**
Even after my skin has been destroyed, yet in my flesh I will see God.
- **Job 19:27**
I will see Him for myself; my eyes will behold Him, and not as a stranger. How my heart yearns within me!
- **Job 19:28**
If you say, ‘Let us persecute him, since the root of the matter lies with him,’
- **Job 19:29**
then you should fear the sword yourselves, because wrath brings punishment by the sword, so that you may know there is a judgment.”
- **Job 20:1**
Then Zophar the Naamathite replied:
- **Job 20:2**
“So my anxious thoughts compel me to answer, because of the turmoil within me.
- **Job 20:3**
I have heard a rebuke that insults me, and my understanding prompts a reply.
- **Job 20:4**
Do you not know that from antiquity, since man was placed on the earth,
- **Job 20:5**
the triumph of the wicked has been brief and the joy of the godless momentary?
- **Job 20:6**
Though his arrogance reaches the heavens, and his head touches the clouds,
- **Job 20:7**
he will perish forever, like his own dung; those who had seen him will ask, ‘Where is he?’
- **Job 20:8**
He will fly away like a dream, never to be found; he will be chased away like a vision in the night.
- **Job 20:9**
The eye that saw him will see him no more, and his place will no longer behold him.
- **Job 20:10**
His sons will seek the favor of the poor, for his own hands must return his wealth.
- **Job 20:11**
The youthful vigor that fills his bones will lie down with him in the dust.
- **Job 20:12**
Though evil is sweet in his mouth and he conceals it under his tongue,
- **Job 20:13**
though he cannot bear to let it go and keeps it in his mouth,
- **Job 20:14**
yet in his stomach his food sours into the venom of cobras within him.
- **Job 20:15**
He swallows wealth but vomits it out; God will force it from his stomach.
- **Job 20:16**
He will suck the poison of cobras; the fangs of a viper will kill him.
- **Job 20:17**
He will not enjoy the streams, the rivers flowing with honey and cream.
- **Job 20:18**
He must return the fruit of his labor without consuming it; he cannot enjoy the profits of his trading.
- **Job 20:19**
For he has oppressed and forsaken the poor; he has seized houses he did not build.
- **Job 20:20**
Because his appetite is never satisfied, he cannot escape with his treasure.
- **Job 20:21**
Nothing is left for him to consume; thus his prosperity will not endure.
- **Job 20:22**
In the midst of his plenty, he will be distressed; the full force of misery will come upon him.
- **Job 20:23**
When he has filled his stomach, God will vent His fury upon him, raining it down on him as he eats.
- **Job 20:24**
Though he flees from an iron weapon, a bronze-tipped arrow will pierce him.
- **Job 20:25**
It is drawn out of his back, the gleaming point from his liver. Terrors come over him.
- **Job 20:26**
Total darkness is reserved for his treasures. A fire unfanned will consume him and devour what is left in his tent.
- **Job 20:27**
The heavens will expose his iniquity, and the earth will rise up against him.
- **Job 20:28**
The possessions of his house will be removed, flowing away on the day of God’s wrath.
- **Job 20:29**
This is the wicked man’s portion from God, the inheritance God has appointed him.”
- **Job 21:1**
Then Job answered:
- **Job 21:2**
“Listen carefully to my words; let this be your consolation to me.
- **Job 21:3**
Bear with me while I speak; then, after I have spoken, you may go on mocking.
- **Job 21:4**
Is my complaint against a man? Then why should I not be impatient?
- **Job 21:5**
Look at me and be appalled; put your hand over your mouth.
- **Job 21:6**
When I remember, terror takes hold, and my body trembles in horror.
- **Job 21:7**
Why do the wicked live on, growing old and increasing in power?
- **Job 21:8**
Their descendants are established around them, and their offspring before their eyes.
- **Job 21:9**
Their homes are safe from fear; no rod of punishment from God is upon them.
- **Job 21:10**
Their bulls breed without fail; their cows bear calves and do not miscarry.
- **Job 21:11**
They send forth their little ones like a flock; their children skip about,
- **Job 21:12**
singing to the tambourine and lyre and making merry at the sound of the flute.
- **Job 21:13**
They spend their days in prosperity and go down to Sheol in peace.
- **Job 21:14**
Yet they say to God: ‘Leave us alone! For we have no desire to know Your ways.
- **Job 21:15**
Who is the Almighty, that we should serve Him, and what would we gain if we pray to Him?’
- **Job 21:16**
Still, their prosperity is not in their own hands, so I stay far from the counsel of the wicked.
- **Job 21:17**
How often is the lamp of the wicked put out? Does disaster come upon them? Does God, in His anger, apportion destruction?
- **Job 21:18**
Are they like straw before the wind, like chaff swept away by a storm?
- **Job 21:19**
It is said that God lays up one’s punishment for his children. Let God repay the man himself, so he will know it.
- **Job 21:20**
Let his eyes see his own destruction; let him drink for himself the wrath of the Almighty.
- **Job 21:21**
For what does he care about his household after him, when the number of his months has run out?
- **Job 21:22**
Can anyone teach knowledge to God, since He judges those on high?
- **Job 21:23**
One man dies full of vigor, completely secure and at ease.
- **Job 21:24**
His body is well nourished, and his bones are rich with marrow.
- **Job 21:25**
Yet another man dies in the bitterness of his soul, having never tasted prosperity.
- **Job 21:26**
But together they lie down in the dust, and worms cover them both.
- **Job 21:27**
Behold, I know your thoughts full well, the schemes by which you would wrong me.
- **Job 21:28**
For you say, ‘Where now is the nobleman’s house, and where are the tents in which the wicked dwell?’
- **Job 21:29**
Have you never asked those who travel the roads? Do you not accept their reports?
- **Job 21:30**
Indeed, the evil man is spared from the day of calamity, delivered from the day of wrath.
- **Job 21:31**
Who denounces his behavior to his face? Who repays him for what he has done?
- **Job 21:32**
He is carried to the grave, and watch is kept over his tomb.
- **Job 21:33**
The clods of the valley are sweet to him; everyone follows behind him, and those before him are without number.
- **Job 21:34**
So how can you comfort me with empty words? For your answers remain full of falsehood.”
- **Job 22:1**
Then Eliphaz the Temanite replied:
- **Job 22:2**
“Can a man be of use to God? Can even a wise man benefit Him?
- **Job 22:3**
Does it delight the Almighty that you are righteous? Does He profit if your ways are blameless?
- **Job 22:4**
Is it for your reverence that He rebukes you and enters into judgment against you?
- **Job 22:5**
Is not your wickedness great? Are not your iniquities endless?
- **Job 22:6**
For you needlessly demanded security from your brothers and deprived the naked of their clothing.
- **Job 22:7**
You gave no water to the weary and withheld food from the famished,
- **Job 22:8**
while the land belonged to a mighty man, and a man of honor lived on it.
- **Job 22:9**
You sent widows away empty-handed, and the strength of the fatherless was crushed.
- **Job 22:10**
Therefore snares surround you, and sudden peril terrifies you;
- **Job 22:11**
it is so dark you cannot see, and a flood of water covers you.
- **Job 22:12**
Is not God as high as the heavens? Look at the highest stars, how lofty they are!
- **Job 22:13**
Yet you say: ‘What does God know? Does He judge through thick darkness?
- **Job 22:14**
Thick clouds veil Him so He does not see us as He traverses the vault of heaven.’
- **Job 22:15**
Will you stay on the ancient path that wicked men have trod?
- **Job 22:16**
They were snatched away before their time, and their foundations were swept away by a flood.
- **Job 22:17**
They said to God, ‘Depart from us. What can the Almighty do to us?’
- **Job 22:18**
But it was He who filled their houses with good things; so I stay far from the counsel of the wicked.
- **Job 22:19**
The righteous see it and are glad; the innocent mock them:
- **Job 22:20**
‘Surely our foes are destroyed, and fire has consumed their excess.’
- **Job 22:21**
Reconcile now and be at peace with Him; thereby good will come to you.
- **Job 22:22**
Receive instruction from His mouth, and lay up His words in your heart.
- **Job 22:23**
If you return to the Almighty, you will be restored. If you remove injustice from your tents
- **Job 22:24**
and consign your gold to the dust and the gold of Ophir to the stones of the ravines,
- **Job 22:25**
then the Almighty will be your gold and the finest silver for you.
- **Job 22:26**
Surely then you will delight in the Almighty and lift up your face to God.
- **Job 22:27**
You will pray to Him, and He will hear you, and you will fulfill your vows.
- **Job 22:28**
Your decisions will be carried out, and light will shine on your ways.
- **Job 22:29**
When men are brought low and you say, ‘Lift them up!’ then He will save the lowly.
- **Job 22:30**
He will deliver even one who is not innocent, rescuing him through the cleanness of your hands.”
- **Job 23:1**
Then Job answered:
- **Job 23:2**
“Even today my complaint is bitter. His hand is heavy despite my groaning.
- **Job 23:3**
If only I knew where to find Him, so that I could go to His seat.
- **Job 23:4**
I would plead my case before Him and fill my mouth with arguments.
- **Job 23:5**
I would learn how He would answer, and consider what He would say.
- **Job 23:6**
Would He contend with me in His great power? No, He would certainly take note of me.
- **Job 23:7**
Then an upright man could reason with Him, and I would be delivered forever from my Judge.
- **Job 23:8**
If I go east, He is not there, and if I go west, I cannot find Him.
- **Job 23:9**
When He is at work in the north, I cannot behold Him; when He turns to the south, I cannot see Him.
- **Job 23:10**
Yet He knows the way I have taken; when He has tested me, I will come forth as gold.
- **Job 23:11**
My feet have followed in His tracks; I have kept His way without turning aside.
- **Job 23:12**
I have not departed from the command of His lips; I have treasured the words of His mouth more than my daily bread.
- **Job 23:13**
But He is unchangeable, and who can oppose Him? He does what He desires.
- **Job 23:14**
For He carries out His decree against me, and He has many such plans.
- **Job 23:15**
Therefore I am terrified in His presence; when I consider this, I fear Him.
- **Job 23:16**
God has made my heart faint; the Almighty has terrified me.
- **Job 23:17**
Yet I am not silenced by the darkness, by the thick darkness that covers my face.
- **Job 24:1**
“Why does the Almighty not reserve times for judgment? Why may those who know Him never see His days?
- **Job 24:2**
Men move boundary stones; they pasture stolen flocks.
- **Job 24:3**
They drive away the donkey of the fatherless and take the widow’s ox in pledge.
- **Job 24:4**
They push the needy off the road and force all the poor of the land into hiding.
- **Job 24:5**
Indeed, like wild donkeys in the desert, the poor go to work foraging for food; the wasteland is food for their children.
- **Job 24:6**
They gather fodder in the fields and glean the vineyards of the wicked.
- **Job 24:7**
Without clothing, they spend the night naked; they have no covering against the cold.
- **Job 24:8**
Drenched by mountain rains, they huddle against the rocks for want of shelter.
- **Job 24:9**
The fatherless infant is snatched from the breast; the nursing child of the poor is seized for a debt.
- **Job 24:10**
Without clothing, they wander about naked. They carry the sheaves, but still go hungry.
- **Job 24:11**
They crush olives within their walls; they tread the winepresses, but go thirsty.
- **Job 24:12**
From the city, men groan, and the souls of the wounded cry out, yet God charges no one with wrongdoing.
- **Job 24:13**
Then there are those who rebel against the light, not knowing its ways or staying on its paths.
- **Job 24:14**
When daylight is gone, the murderer rises to kill the poor and needy; in the night he is like a thief.
- **Job 24:15**
The eye of the adulterer watches for twilight. Thinking, ‘No eye will see me,’ he covers his face.
- **Job 24:16**
In the dark they dig through houses; by day they shut themselves in, never to experience the light.
- **Job 24:17**
For to them, deep darkness is their morning; surely they are friends with the terrors of darkness!
- **Job 24:18**
They are but foam on the surface of the water; their portion of the land is cursed, so that no one turns toward their vineyards.
- **Job 24:19**
As drought and heat consume the melting snow, so Sheol steals those who have sinned.
- **Job 24:20**
The womb forgets them; the worm feeds on them; they are remembered no more. So injustice is like a broken tree.
- **Job 24:21**
They prey on the barren and childless, and show no kindness to the widow.
- **Job 24:22**
Yet by His power, God drags away the mighty; though rising up, they have no assurance of life.
- **Job 24:23**
He gives them a sense of security, but His eyes are on their ways.
- **Job 24:24**
They are exalted for a moment, then they are gone; they are brought low and gathered up like all others; they are cut off like heads of grain.
- **Job 24:25**
If this is not so, then who can prove me a liar and reduce my words to nothing?”
- **Job 25:1**
Then Bildad the Shuhite replied:
- **Job 25:2**
“Dominion and awe belong to God; He establishes harmony in the heights of heaven.
- **Job 25:3**
Can His troops be numbered? On whom does His light not rise?
- **Job 25:4**
How then can a man be just before God? How can one born of woman be pure?
- **Job 25:5**
If even the moon does not shine, and the stars are not pure in His sight,
- **Job 25:6**
how much less man, who is but a maggot, and the son of man, who is but a worm!”
- **Job 26:1**
Then Job answered:
- **Job 26:2**
“How you have helped the powerless and saved the arm that is feeble!
- **Job 26:3**
How you have counseled the unwise and provided fully sound insight!
- **Job 26:4**
To whom have you uttered these words? And whose spirit spoke through you?
- **Job 26:5**
The dead tremble—those beneath the waters and those who dwell in them.
- **Job 26:6**
Sheol is naked before God, and Abaddon has no covering.
- **Job 26:7**
He stretches out the north over empty space; He hangs the earth upon nothing.
- **Job 26:8**
He wraps up the waters in His clouds, yet the clouds do not burst under their own weight.
- **Job 26:9**
He covers the face of the full moon, spreading over it His cloud.
- **Job 26:10**
He has inscribed a horizon on the face of the waters at the boundary between light and darkness.
- **Job 26:11**
The foundations of heaven quake, astounded at His rebuke.
- **Job 26:12**
By His power He stirred the sea; by His understanding He shattered Rahab.
- **Job 26:13**
By His breath the skies were cleared; His hand pierced the fleeing serpent.
- **Job 26:14**
Indeed, these are but the fringes of His ways; how faint is the whisper we hear of Him! Who then can understand the thunder of His power?”
- **Job 27:1**
Job continued his discourse:
- **Job 27:2**
“As surely as God lives, who has deprived me of justice—the Almighty, who has embittered my soul—
- **Job 27:3**
as long as my breath is still within me and the breath of God remains in my nostrils,
- **Job 27:4**
my lips will not speak wickedness, and my tongue will not utter deceit.
- **Job 27:5**
I will never say that you are right; I will maintain my integrity until I die.
- **Job 27:6**
I will cling to my righteousness and never let go. As long as I live, my conscience will not accuse me.
- **Job 27:7**
May my enemy be like the wicked and my opponent like the unjust.
- **Job 27:8**
For what is the hope of the godless when he is cut off, when God takes away his life?
- **Job 27:9**
Will God hear his cry when distress comes upon him?
- **Job 27:10**
Will he delight in the Almighty? Will he call upon God at all times?
- **Job 27:11**
I will instruct you in the power of God. I will not conceal the ways of the Almighty.
- **Job 27:12**
Surely all of you have seen it for yourselves. Why then do you keep up this empty talk?
- **Job 27:13**
This is the wicked man’s portion from God—the heritage the ruthless receive from the Almighty.
- **Job 27:14**
Though his sons are many, they are destined for the sword; and his offspring will never have enough food.
- **Job 27:15**
His survivors will be buried by the plague, and their widows will not weep for them.
- **Job 27:16**
Though he heaps up silver like dust and piles up a wardrobe like clay,
- **Job 27:17**
what he lays up, the righteous will wear, and his silver will be divided by the innocent.
- **Job 27:18**
The house he built is like a moth’s cocoon, like a hut set up by a watchman.
- **Job 27:19**
He lies down wealthy, but will do so no more; when he opens his eyes, all is gone.
- **Job 27:20**
Terrors overtake him like a flood; a tempest sweeps him away in the night.
- **Job 27:21**
The east wind carries him away, and he is gone; it sweeps him out of his place.
- **Job 27:22**
It hurls itself against him without mercy as he flees headlong from its power.
- **Job 27:23**
It claps its hands at him and hisses him out of his place.
- **Job 28:1**
“Surely there is a mine for silver and a place where gold is refined.
- **Job 28:2**
Iron is taken from the earth, and copper is smelted from ore.
- **Job 28:3**
Man puts an end to the darkness; he probes the farthest recesses for ore in deepest darkness.
- **Job 28:4**
Far from human habitation he cuts a shaft in places forgotten by the foot of man. Far from men he dangles and sways.
- **Job 28:5**
Food may come from the earth, but from below it is transformed as by fire.
- **Job 28:6**
Its rocks are the source of sapphires, containing flecks of gold.
- **Job 28:7**
No bird of prey knows that path; no falcon’s eye has seen it.
- **Job 28:8**
Proud beasts have never trodden it; no lion has ever prowled over it.
- **Job 28:9**
The miner strikes the flint; he overturns mountains at their base.
- **Job 28:10**
He hews out channels in the rocks, and his eyes spot every treasure.
- **Job 28:11**
He stops up the sources of the streams to bring what is hidden to light.
- **Job 28:12**
But where can wisdom be found, and where does understanding dwell?
- **Job 28:13**
No man can know its value, nor is it found in the land of the living.
- **Job 28:14**
The ocean depths say, ‘It is not in me,’ while the sea declares, ‘It is not with me.’
- **Job 28:15**
It cannot be bought with gold, nor can its price be weighed out in silver.
- **Job 28:16**
It cannot be valued in the gold of Ophir, in precious onyx or sapphire.
- **Job 28:17**
Neither gold nor crystal can compare to it, nor jewels of fine gold be exchanged for it.
- **Job 28:18**
Coral and quartz are unworthy of mention; the price of wisdom is beyond rubies.
- **Job 28:19**
Topaz from Cush cannot compare to it, nor can it be valued in pure gold.
- **Job 28:20**
From where then does wisdom come, and where does understanding dwell?
- **Job 28:21**
It is hidden from the eyes of every living thing and concealed from the birds of the air.
- **Job 28:22**
Abaddon and Death say, ‘We have heard a rumor about it.’
- **Job 28:23**
But God understands its way, and He knows its place.
- **Job 28:24**
For He looks to the ends of the earth and sees everything under the heavens.
- **Job 28:25**
When God fixed the weight of the wind and measured out the waters,
- **Job 28:26**
when He set a limit for the rain and a path for the thunderbolt,
- **Job 28:27**
then He looked at wisdom and appraised it; He established it and searched it out.
- **Job 28:28**
And He said to man, ‘Behold, the fear of the Lord, that is wisdom, and to turn away from evil is understanding.’”
- **Job 29:1**
And Job continued his discourse:
- **Job 29:2**
“How I long for the months gone by, for the days when God watched over me,
- **Job 29:3**
when His lamp shone above my head, and by His light I walked through the darkness,
- **Job 29:4**
when I was in my prime, when the friendship of God rested on my tent,
- **Job 29:5**
when the Almighty was still with me and my children were around me,
- **Job 29:6**
when my steps were bathed in cream and the rock poured out for me streams of oil!
- **Job 29:7**
When I went out to the city gate and took my seat in the public square,
- **Job 29:8**
the young men saw me and withdrew, and the old men rose to their feet.
- **Job 29:9**
The princes refrained from speaking and covered their mouths with their hands.
- **Job 29:10**
The voices of the nobles were hushed, and their tongues stuck to the roofs of their mouths.
- **Job 29:11**
For those who heard me called me blessed, and those who saw me commended me,
- **Job 29:12**
because I rescued the poor who cried out and the fatherless who had no helper.
- **Job 29:13**
The dying man blessed me, and I made the widow’s heart sing for joy.
- **Job 29:14**
I put on righteousness, and it clothed me; justice was my robe and my turban.
- **Job 29:15**
I served as eyes to the blind and as feet to the lame.
- **Job 29:16**
I was a father to the needy, and I took up the case of the stranger.
- **Job 29:17**
I shattered the fangs of the unjust and snatched the prey from his teeth.
- **Job 29:18**
So I thought: ‘I will die in my nest and multiply my days as the sand.
- **Job 29:19**
My roots will spread out to the waters, and the dew will rest nightly on my branches.
- **Job 29:20**
My glory is ever new within me, and my bow is renewed in my hand.’
- **Job 29:21**
Men listened to me with expectation, waiting silently for my counsel.
- **Job 29:22**
After my words, they spoke no more; my speech settled on them like dew.
- **Job 29:23**
They waited for me as for rain and drank in my words like spring showers.
- **Job 29:24**
If I smiled at them, they did not believe it; the light of my countenance was precious.
- **Job 29:25**
I chose their course and presided as chief. So I dwelt as a king among his troops, as a comforter of the mourners.
- **Job 30:1**
“But now they mock me, men younger than I am, whose fathers I would have refused to entrust with my sheep dogs.
- **Job 30:2**
What use to me was the strength of their hands, since their vigor had left them?
- **Job 30:3**
Gaunt from poverty and hunger, they gnawed the dry land, and the desolate wasteland by night.
- **Job 30:4**
They plucked mallow among the shrubs, and the roots of the broom tree were their food.
- **Job 30:5**
They were banished from among men, shouted down like thieves,
- **Job 30:6**
so that they lived on the slopes of the wadis, among the rocks and in holes in the ground.
- **Job 30:7**
They cried out among the shrubs and huddled beneath the nettles.
- **Job 30:8**
A senseless and nameless brood, they were driven off the land.
- **Job 30:9**
And now they mock me in song; I have become a byword among them.
- **Job 30:10**
They abhor me and keep far from me; they do not hesitate to spit in my face.
- **Job 30:11**
Because God has unstrung my bow and afflicted me, they have cast off restraint in my presence.
- **Job 30:12**
The rabble arises at my right; they lay snares for my feet and build siege ramps against me.
- **Job 30:13**
They tear up my path; they profit from my destruction, with no one to restrain them.
- **Job 30:14**
They advance as through a wide breach; through the ruins they keep rolling in.
- **Job 30:15**
Terrors are turned loose against me; they drive away my dignity as by the wind, and my prosperity has passed like a cloud.
- **Job 30:16**
And now my soul is poured out within me; days of affliction grip me.
- **Job 30:17**
Night pierces my bones, and my gnawing pains never rest.
- **Job 30:18**
With great force He grasps my garment; He seizes me by the collar of my tunic.
- **Job 30:19**
He throws me into the mud, and I have become like dust and ashes.
- **Job 30:20**
I cry out to You for help, but You do not answer; when I stand up, You merely look at me.
- **Job 30:21**
You have ruthlessly turned on me; You oppose me with Your strong hand.
- **Job 30:22**
You snatch me up into the wind and drive me before it; You toss me about in the storm.
- **Job 30:23**
Yes, I know that You will bring me down to death, to the place appointed for all the living.
- **Job 30:24**
Yet no one stretches out his hand to a ruined man when he cries for help in his distress.
- **Job 30:25**
Have I not wept for those in trouble? Has my soul not grieved for the needy?
- **Job 30:26**
But when I hoped for good, evil came; when I looked for light, darkness fell.
- **Job 30:27**
I am churning within and cannot rest; days of affliction confront me.
- **Job 30:28**
I go about blackened, but not by the sun. I stand up in the assembly and cry for help.
- **Job 30:29**
I have become a brother of jackals, a companion of ostriches.
- **Job 30:30**
My skin grows black and peels, and my bones burn with fever.
- **Job 30:31**
My harp is tuned to mourning and my flute to the sound of weeping.
- **Job 31:1**
“I have made a covenant with my eyes. How then could I gaze with desire at a virgin?
- **Job 31:2**
For what is the allotment of God from above, or the heritage from the Almighty on high?
- **Job 31:3**
Does not disaster come to the unjust and calamity to the workers of iniquity?
- **Job 31:4**
Does He not see my ways and count my every step?
- **Job 31:5**
If I have walked in falsehood or my foot has rushed to deceit,
- **Job 31:6**
let God weigh me with honest scales, that He may know my integrity.
- **Job 31:7**
If my steps have turned from the path, if my heart has followed my eyes, or if impurity has stuck to my hands,
- **Job 31:8**
then may another eat what I have sown, and may my crops be uprooted.
- **Job 31:9**
If my heart has been enticed by my neighbor’s wife, or I have lurked at his door,
- **Job 31:10**
then may my own wife grind grain for another, and may other men sleep with her.
- **Job 31:11**
For that would be a heinous crime, an iniquity to be judged.
- **Job 31:12**
For it is a fire that burns down to Abaddon; it would root out my entire harvest.
- **Job 31:13**
If I have rejected the cause of my manservant or maidservant when they made a complaint against me,
- **Job 31:14**
what will I do when God rises to judge? How will I answer when called to account?
- **Job 31:15**
Did not He who made me in the womb also make them? Did not the same One form us in the womb?
- **Job 31:16**
If I have denied the desires of the poor or allowed the widow’s eyes to fail,
- **Job 31:17**
if I have eaten my morsel alone, not sharing it with the fatherless—
- **Job 31:18**
though from my youth I reared him as would a father, and from my mother’s womb I guided the widow—
- **Job 31:19**
if I have seen one perish for lack of clothing, or a needy man without a cloak,
- **Job 31:20**
if his heart has not blessed me for warming him with the fleece of my sheep,
- **Job 31:21**
if I have lifted up my hand against the fatherless because I saw that I had support in the gate,
- **Job 31:22**
then may my arm fall from my shoulder and be torn from its socket.
- **Job 31:23**
For calamity from God terrifies me, and His splendor I cannot overpower.
- **Job 31:24**
If I have put my trust in gold or called pure gold my security,
- **Job 31:25**
if I have rejoiced in my great wealth because my hand had gained so much,
- **Job 31:26**
if I have beheld the sun in its radiance or the moon moving in splendor,
- **Job 31:27**
so that my heart was secretly enticed and my hand threw a kiss from my mouth,
- **Job 31:28**
this would also be an iniquity to be judged, for I would have denied God on high.
- **Job 31:29**
If I have rejoiced in my enemy’s ruin, or exulted when evil befell him—
- **Job 31:30**
I have not allowed my mouth to sin by asking for his life with a curse—
- **Job 31:31**
if the men of my house have not said, ‘Who is there who has not had his fill?’—
- **Job 31:32**
but no stranger had to lodge on the street, for my door has been open to the traveler—
- **Job 31:33**
if I have covered my transgressions like Adam by hiding my guilt in my heart,
- **Job 31:34**
because I greatly feared the crowds and the contempt of the clans terrified me, so that I kept silent and would not go outside—
- **Job 31:35**
(Oh, that I had one to hear me! Here is my signature. Let the Almighty answer me; let my accuser compose an indictment.
- **Job 31:36**
Surely I would carry it on my shoulder and wear it like a crown.
- **Job 31:37**
I would give account of all my steps; I would approach Him like a prince.)—
- **Job 31:38**
if my land cries out against me and its furrows weep together,
- **Job 31:39**
if I have devoured its produce without payment or broken the spirit of its tenants,
- **Job 31:40**
then let briers grow instead of wheat and stinkweed instead of barley.” Thus conclude the words of Job.
- **Job 32:1**
So these three men stopped answering Job, because he was righteous in his own eyes.
- **Job 32:2**
This kindled the anger of Elihu son of Barachel the Buzite, of the family of Ram. He burned with anger against Job for justifying himself rather than God,
- **Job 32:3**
and he burned with anger against Job’s three friends because they had failed to refute Job, and yet had condemned him.
- **Job 32:4**
Now Elihu had waited to speak to Job because the others were older than he.
- **Job 32:5**
But when he saw that the three men had no further reply, his anger was kindled.
- **Job 32:6**
So Elihu son of Barachel the Buzite declared: “I am young in years, while you are old; that is why I was timid and afraid to tell you what I know.
- **Job 32:7**
I thought that age should speak, and many years should teach wisdom.
- **Job 32:8**
But there is a spirit in a man, the breath of the Almighty, that gives him understanding.
- **Job 32:9**
It is not only the old who are wise, or the elderly who understand justice.
- **Job 32:10**
Therefore I say, ‘Listen to me; I too will declare what I know.’
- **Job 32:11**
Indeed, I waited while you spoke; I listened to your reasoning; as you searched for words,
- **Job 32:12**
I paid you full attention. But no one proved Job wrong; not one of you rebutted his arguments.
- **Job 32:13**
So do not claim, ‘We have found wisdom; let God, not man, refute him.’
- **Job 32:14**
But Job has not directed his words against me, and I will not answer him with your arguments.
- **Job 32:15**
Job’s friends are dismayed, with no more to say; words have escaped them.
- **Job 32:16**
Must I wait, now that they are silent, now that they stand and no longer reply?
- **Job 32:17**
I too will answer; yes, I will declare what I know.
- **Job 32:18**
For I am full of words, and my spirit within me compels me.
- **Job 32:19**
Behold, my belly is like unvented wine; it is about to burst like a new wineskin.
- **Job 32:20**
I must speak and find relief; I must open my lips and respond.
- **Job 32:21**
I will be partial to no one, nor will I flatter any man.
- **Job 32:22**
For I do not know how to flatter, or my Maker would remove me in an instant.
- **Job 33:1**
“But now, O Job, hear my speech, and listen to all my words.
- **Job 33:2**
Behold, I will open my mouth; my address is on the tip of my tongue.
- **Job 33:3**
My words are from an upright heart, and my lips speak sincerely what I know.
- **Job 33:4**
The Spirit of God has made me, and the breath of the Almighty gives me life.
- **Job 33:5**
Refute me if you can; prepare your case and confront me.
- **Job 33:6**
I am just like you before God; I was also formed from clay.
- **Job 33:7**
Surely no fear of me should terrify you; nor will my hand be heavy upon you.
- **Job 33:8**
Surely you have spoken in my hearing, and I have heard these very words:
- **Job 33:9**
‘I am pure, without transgression; I am clean, with no iniquity in me.
- **Job 33:10**
Yet God finds occasions against me; He counts me as His enemy.
- **Job 33:11**
He puts my feet in the stocks; He watches over all my paths.’
- **Job 33:12**
Behold, you are not right in this matter. I will answer you, for God is greater than man.
- **Job 33:13**
Why do you complain to Him that He answers nothing a man asks?
- **Job 33:14**
For God speaks in one way and in another, yet no one notices.
- **Job 33:15**
In a dream, in a vision in the night, when deep sleep falls upon men as they slumber on their beds,
- **Job 33:16**
He opens their ears and terrifies them with warnings
- **Job 33:17**
to turn a man from wrongdoing and keep him from pride,
- **Job 33:18**
to preserve his soul from the Pit and his life from perishing by the sword.
- **Job 33:19**
A man is also chastened on his bed with pain and constant distress in his bones,
- **Job 33:20**
so that he detests his bread, and his soul loathes his favorite food.
- **Job 33:21**
His flesh wastes away from sight, and his hidden bones protrude.
- **Job 33:22**
He draws near to the Pit, and his life to the messengers of death.
- **Job 33:23**
Yet if there is a messenger on his side, one mediator in a thousand, to tell a man what is right for him,
- **Job 33:24**
to be gracious to him and say, ‘Spare him from going down to the Pit; I have found his ransom,’
- **Job 33:25**
then his flesh is refreshed like a child’s; he returns to the days of his youth.
- **Job 33:26**
He prays to God and finds favor; he sees God’s face and shouts for joy, and God restores His righteousness to that man.
- **Job 33:27**
Then he sings before men with these words: ‘I have sinned and perverted what was right; yet I did not get what I deserved.
- **Job 33:28**
He redeemed my soul from going down to the Pit, and I will live to see the light.’
- **Job 33:29**
Behold, all these things God does to a man, two or even three times,
- **Job 33:30**
to bring back his soul from the Pit, that he may be enlightened with the light of life.
- **Job 33:31**
Pay attention, Job, and listen to me; be silent, and I will speak.
- **Job 33:32**
But if you have something to say, answer me; speak up, for I would like to vindicate you.
- **Job 33:33**
But if not, then listen to me; be quiet, and I will teach you wisdom.”
- **Job 34:1**
Then Elihu continued:
- **Job 34:2**
“Hear my words, O wise men; give ear to me, O men of learning.
- **Job 34:3**
For the ear tests words as the mouth tastes food.
- **Job 34:4**
Let us choose for ourselves what is right; let us learn together what is good.
- **Job 34:5**
For Job has declared, ‘I am righteous, yet God has deprived me of justice.
- **Job 34:6**
Would I lie about my case? My wound is incurable, though I am without transgression.’
- **Job 34:7**
What man is like Job, who drinks up derision like water?
- **Job 34:8**
He keeps company with evildoers and walks with wicked men.
- **Job 34:9**
For he has said, ‘It profits a man nothing that he should delight in God.’
- **Job 34:10**
Therefore listen to me, O men of understanding. Far be it from God to do wrong, and from the Almighty to act unjustly.
- **Job 34:11**
For according to a man’s deeds He repays him; according to a man’s ways He brings consequences.
- **Job 34:12**
Indeed, it is true that God does not act wickedly, and the Almighty does not pervert justice.
- **Job 34:13**
Who gave Him charge over the earth? Who appointed Him over the whole world?
- **Job 34:14**
If He were to set His heart to it and withdraw His Spirit and breath,
- **Job 34:15**
all flesh would perish together and mankind would return to the dust.
- **Job 34:16**
If you have understanding, hear this; listen to my words.
- **Job 34:17**
Could one who hates justice govern? Will you condemn the just and mighty One,
- **Job 34:18**
who says to kings, ‘You are worthless!’ and to nobles, ‘You are wicked,’
- **Job 34:19**
who is not partial to princes and does not favor rich over poor? For they are all the work of His hands.
- **Job 34:20**
They die in an instant, in the middle of the night. The people convulse and pass away; the mighty are removed without human hand.
- **Job 34:21**
For His eyes are on the ways of a man, and He sees his every step.
- **Job 34:22**
There is no darkness or deep shadow where the workers of iniquity can hide.
- **Job 34:23**
For God need not examine a man further or have him approach for judgment.
- **Job 34:24**
He shatters the mighty without inquiry and sets up others in their place.
- **Job 34:25**
Therefore, He recognizes their deeds; He overthrows them in the night and they are crushed.
- **Job 34:26**
He strikes them for their wickedness in full view,
- **Job 34:27**
because they turned aside from Him and had no regard for any of His ways.
- **Job 34:28**
They caused the cry of the poor to come before Him, and He heard the outcry of the afflicted.
- **Job 34:29**
But when He remains silent, who can condemn Him? When He hides His face, who can see Him? Yet He watches over both man and nation,
- **Job 34:30**
that godless men should not rule or lay snares for the people.
- **Job 34:31**
Suppose someone says to God, ‘I have endured my punishment; I will offend no more.
- **Job 34:32**
Teach me what I cannot see; if I have done wrong, I will not do it again.’
- **Job 34:33**
Should God repay you on your own terms when you have disavowed His? You must choose, not I; so tell me what you know.
- **Job 34:34**
Men of understanding will declare to me, and the wise men who hear me will say:
- **Job 34:35**
‘Job speaks without knowledge; his words lack insight.’
- **Job 34:36**
If only Job were tried to the utmost for answering like a wicked man.
- **Job 34:37**
For he adds rebellion to his sin; he claps his hands among us and multiplies his words against God.”
- **Job 35:1**
And Elihu went on to say:
- **Job 35:2**
“Do you think this is just? You say, ‘I am more righteous than God.’
- **Job 35:3**
For you ask, ‘What does it profit me, and what benefit do I gain apart from sin?’
- **Job 35:4**
I will reply to you and to your friends as well.
- **Job 35:5**
Look to the heavens and see; gaze at the clouds high above you.
- **Job 35:6**
If you sin, what do you accomplish against Him? If you multiply your transgressions, what do you do to Him?
- **Job 35:7**
If you are righteous, what do you give Him, or what does He receive from your hand?
- **Job 35:8**
Your wickedness affects only a man like yourself, and your righteousness only a son of man.
- **Job 35:9**
Men cry out under great oppression; they plead for relief from the arm of the mighty.
- **Job 35:10**
But no one asks, ‘Where is God my Maker, who gives us songs in the night,
- **Job 35:11**
who teaches us more than the beasts of the earth and makes us wiser than the birds of the air?’
- **Job 35:12**
There they cry out, but He does not answer, because of the pride of evil men.
- **Job 35:13**
Surely God does not listen to empty pleas, and the Almighty does not take note of it.
- **Job 35:14**
How much less, then, when you say that you do not see Him, that your case is before Him and you must wait for Him,
- **Job 35:15**
and further, that in His anger He has not punished or taken much notice of folly!
- **Job 35:16**
So Job opens his mouth in vain and multiplies words without knowledge.”
- **Job 36:1**
And Elihu continued:
- **Job 36:2**
“Bear with me a little longer, and I will show you that there is more to be said on God’s behalf.
- **Job 36:3**
I get my knowledge from afar, and I will ascribe justice to my Maker.
- **Job 36:4**
For truly my words are free of falsehood; one perfect in knowledge is with you.
- **Job 36:5**
Indeed, God is mighty, but He despises no one; He is mighty in strength of understanding.
- **Job 36:6**
He does not keep the wicked alive, but He grants justice to the afflicted.
- **Job 36:7**
He does not take His eyes off the righteous, but He enthrones them with kings and exalts them forever.
- **Job 36:8**
And if men are bound with chains, caught in cords of affliction,
- **Job 36:9**
then He tells them their deeds and how arrogantly they have transgressed.
- **Job 36:10**
He opens their ears to correction and commands that they turn from iniquity.
- **Job 36:11**
If they obey and serve Him, then they end their days in prosperity and their years in happiness.
- **Job 36:12**
But if they do not obey, then they perish by the sword and die without knowledge.
- **Job 36:13**
The godless in heart harbor resentment; even when He binds them, they do not cry for help.
- **Job 36:14**
They die in their youth, among the male shrine prostitutes.
- **Job 36:15**
God rescues the afflicted by their affliction and opens their ears in oppression.
- **Job 36:16**
Indeed, He drew you from the jaws of distress to a spacious and broad place, to a table full of richness.
- **Job 36:17**
But now you are laden with the judgment due the wicked; judgment and justice have seized you.
- **Job 36:18**
Be careful that no one lures you with riches; do not let a large bribe lead you astray.
- **Job 36:19**
Can your wealth or all your mighty effort keep you from distress?
- **Job 36:20**
Do not long for the night, when people vanish from their homes.
- **Job 36:21**
Be careful not to turn to iniquity, for this you have preferred to affliction.
- **Job 36:22**
Behold, God is exalted in His power. Who is a teacher like Him?
- **Job 36:23**
Who has appointed His way for Him, or told Him, ‘You have done wrong’?
- **Job 36:24**
Remember to magnify His work, which men have praised in song.
- **Job 36:25**
All mankind has seen it; men behold it from afar.
- **Job 36:26**
Indeed, God is great—beyond our knowledge; the number of His years is unsearchable.
- **Job 36:27**
For He draws up drops of water which distill the rain from the mist,
- **Job 36:28**
which the clouds pour out and shower abundantly on mankind.
- **Job 36:29**
Furthermore, who can understand how the clouds spread out, how the thunder roars from His pavilion?
- **Job 36:30**
See how He scatters His lightning around Him and covers the depths of the sea.
- **Job 36:31**
For by these He judges the nations and provides food in abundance.
- **Job 36:32**
He fills His hands with lightning and commands it to strike its mark.
- **Job 36:33**
The thunder declares His presence; even the cattle regard the rising storm.
- **Job 37:1**
“At this my heart also pounds and leaps from its place.
- **Job 37:2**
Listen closely to the thunder of His voice and the rumbling that comes from His mouth.
- **Job 37:3**
He unleashes His lightning beneath the whole sky and sends it to the ends of the earth.
- **Job 37:4**
Then there comes a roaring sound; He thunders with His majestic voice. He does not restrain the lightning when His voice resounds.
- **Job 37:5**
God thunders wondrously with His voice; He does great things we cannot comprehend.
- **Job 37:6**
For He says to the snow, ‘Fall on the earth,’ and to the gentle rain, ‘Pour out a mighty downpour.’
- **Job 37:7**
He seals up the hand of every man, so that all men may know His work.
- **Job 37:8**
The wild animals enter their lairs; they settle down in their dens.
- **Job 37:9**
The tempest comes from its chamber, and the cold from the driving north winds.
- **Job 37:10**
By the breath of God the ice is formed and the watery expanses are frozen.
- **Job 37:11**
He loads the clouds with moisture; He scatters His lightning through them.
- **Job 37:12**
They swirl about, whirling at His direction, accomplishing all that He commands over the face of all the earth.
- **Job 37:13**
Whether for punishment or for His land, He accomplishes this in His loving devotion.
- **Job 37:14**
Listen to this, O Job; stand still and consider the wonders of God.
- **Job 37:15**
Do you know how God dispatches the clouds or makes the lightning flash?
- **Job 37:16**
Do you understand how the clouds float, those wonders of Him who is perfect in knowledge?
- **Job 37:17**
You whose clothes get hot when the land lies hushed under the south wind,
- **Job 37:18**
can you, like Him, spread out the skies to reflect the heat like a mirror of bronze?
- **Job 37:19**
Teach us what we should say to Him; we cannot draw up our case when our faces are in darkness.
- **Job 37:20**
Should He be told that I want to speak? Would a man ask to be swallowed up?
- **Job 37:21**
Now no one can gaze at the sun when it is bright in the skies after the wind has swept them clean.
- **Job 37:22**
Out of the north He comes in golden splendor; awesome majesty surrounds Him.
- **Job 37:23**
The Almighty is beyond our reach; He is exalted in power! In His justice and great righteousness He does not oppress.
- **Job 37:24**
Therefore, men fear Him, for He is not partial to the wise in heart.”
- **Job 38:1**
Then the LORD answered Job out of the whirlwind and said:
- **Job 38:2**
“Who is this who obscures My counsel by words without knowledge?
- **Job 38:3**
Now brace yourself like a man; I will question you, and you shall inform Me.
- **Job 38:4**
Where were you when I laid the foundations of the earth? Tell Me, if you have understanding.
- **Job 38:5**
Who fixed its measurements? Surely you know! Or who stretched a measuring line across it?
- **Job 38:6**
On what were its foundations set, or who laid its cornerstone,
- **Job 38:7**
while the morning stars sang together and all the sons of God shouted for joy?
- **Job 38:8**
Who enclosed the sea behind doors when it burst forth from the womb,
- **Job 38:9**
when I made the clouds its garment and thick darkness its blanket,
- **Job 38:10**
when I fixed its boundaries and set in place its bars and doors,
- **Job 38:11**
and I declared: ‘You may come this far, but no farther; here your proud waves must stop’?
- **Job 38:12**
In your days, have you commanded the morning or assigned the dawn its place,
- **Job 38:13**
that it might spread to the ends of the earth and shake the wicked out of it?
- **Job 38:14**
The earth takes shape like clay under a seal; its hills stand out like the folds of a garment.
- **Job 38:15**
Light is withheld from the wicked, and their upraised arm is broken.
- **Job 38:16**
Have you journeyed to the vents of the sea or walked in the trenches of the deep?
- **Job 38:17**
Have the gates of death been revealed to you? Have you seen the gates of the shadow of death?
- **Job 38:18**
Have you surveyed the extent of the earth? Tell Me, if you know all this.
- **Job 38:19**
Where is the way to the home of light? Do you know where darkness resides,
- **Job 38:20**
so you can lead it back to its border? Do you know the paths to its home?
- **Job 38:21**
Surely you know, for you were already born! And the number of your days is great!
- **Job 38:22**
Have you entered the storehouses of snow or observed the storehouses of hail,
- **Job 38:23**
which I hold in reserve for times of trouble, for the day of war and battle?
- **Job 38:24**
In which direction is the lightning dispersed, or the east wind scattered over the earth?
- **Job 38:25**
Who cuts a channel for the flood or clears a path for the thunderbolt,
- **Job 38:26**
to bring rain on a barren land, on a desert where no man lives,
- **Job 38:27**
to satisfy the parched wasteland and make it sprout with tender grass?
- **Job 38:28**
Does the rain have a father? Who has begotten the drops of dew?
- **Job 38:29**
From whose womb does the ice emerge? Who gives birth to the frost from heaven,
- **Job 38:30**
when the waters become hard as stone and the surface of the deep is frozen?
- **Job 38:31**
Can you bind the chains of the Pleiades or loosen the belt of Orion?
- **Job 38:32**
Can you bring forth the constellations in their seasons or lead out the Bear and her cubs?
- **Job 38:33**
Do you know the laws of the heavens? Can you set their dominion over the earth?
- **Job 38:34**
Can you command the clouds so that a flood of water covers you?
- **Job 38:35**
Can you send the lightning bolts on their way? Do they report to you, ‘Here we are’?
- **Job 38:36**
Who has put wisdom in the heart or given understanding to the mind?
- **Job 38:37**
Who has the wisdom to count the clouds? Or who can tilt the water jars of the heavens
- **Job 38:38**
when the dust hardens into a mass and the clods of earth stick together?
- **Job 38:39**
Can you hunt the prey for a lioness or satisfy the hunger of young lions
- **Job 38:40**
when they crouch in their dens and lie in wait in the thicket?
- **Job 38:41**
Who provides food for the raven when its young cry out to God as they wander about for lack of food?
- **Job 39:1**
“Do you know when mountain goats give birth? Have you watched the doe bear her fawn?
- **Job 39:2**
Can you count the months they are pregnant? Do you know the time they give birth?
- **Job 39:3**
They crouch down and bring forth their young; they deliver their newborn.
- **Job 39:4**
Their young ones thrive and grow up in the open field; they leave and do not return.
- **Job 39:5**
Who set the wild donkey free? Who released the swift donkey from the harness?
- **Job 39:6**
I made the wilderness his home and the salt flats his dwelling.
- **Job 39:7**
He scorns the tumult of the city and never hears the shouts of a driver.
- **Job 39:8**
He roams the mountains for pasture, searching for any green thing.
- **Job 39:9**
Will the wild ox consent to serve you? Will he stay by your manger at night?
- **Job 39:10**
Can you hold him to the furrow with a harness? Will he plow the valleys behind you?
- **Job 39:11**
Can you rely on his great strength? Will you leave your hard work to him?
- **Job 39:12**
Can you trust him to bring in your grain and gather it to your threshing floor?
- **Job 39:13**
The wings of the ostrich flap joyfully, but cannot match the pinions and feathers of the stork.
- **Job 39:14**
For she leaves her eggs on the ground and lets them warm in the sand.
- **Job 39:15**
She forgets that a foot may crush them, or a wild animal may trample them.
- **Job 39:16**
She treats her young harshly, as if not her own, with no concern that her labor was in vain.
- **Job 39:17**
For God has deprived her of wisdom; He has not endowed her with understanding.
- **Job 39:18**
Yet when she proudly spreads her wings, she laughs at the horse and its rider.
- **Job 39:19**
Do you give strength to the horse or adorn his neck with a mane?
- **Job 39:20**
Do you make him leap like a locust, striking terror with his proud snorting?
- **Job 39:21**
He paws in the valley and rejoices in his strength; he charges into battle.
- **Job 39:22**
He laughs at fear, frightened of nothing; he does not turn back from the sword.
- **Job 39:23**
A quiver rattles at his side, along with a flashing spear and lance.
- **Job 39:24**
Trembling with excitement, he devours the distance; he cannot stand still when the ram’s horn sounds.
- **Job 39:25**
At the blast of the horn, he snorts with fervor. He catches the scent of battle from afar—the shouts of captains and the cry of war.
- **Job 39:26**
Does the hawk take flight by your understanding and spread his wings toward the south?
- **Job 39:27**
Does the eagle soar at your command and make his nest on high?
- **Job 39:28**
He dwells on a cliff and lodges there; his stronghold is on a rocky crag.
- **Job 39:29**
From there he spies out food; his eyes see it from afar.
- **Job 39:30**
His young ones feast on blood; and where the slain are, there he is.”
- **Job 40:1**
And the LORD said to Job:
- **Job 40:2**
“Will the faultfinder contend with the Almighty? Let him who argues with God give an answer.”
- **Job 40:3**
Then Job answered the LORD:
- **Job 40:4**
“Behold, I am insignificant. How can I reply to You? I place my hand over my mouth.
- **Job 40:5**
I have spoken once, but I have no answer—twice, but I have nothing to add.”
- **Job 40:6**
Then the LORD answered Job out of the whirlwind and said:
- **Job 40:7**
“Now brace yourself like a man; I will question you, and you shall inform Me.
- **Job 40:8**
Would you really annul My justice? Would you condemn Me to justify yourself?
- **Job 40:9**
Do you have an arm like God’s? Can you thunder with a voice like His?
- **Job 40:10**
Then adorn yourself with majesty and splendor, and clothe yourself with honor and glory.
- **Job 40:11**
Unleash the fury of your wrath; look on every proud man and bring him low.
- **Job 40:12**
Look on every proud man and humble him; trample the wicked where they stand.
- **Job 40:13**
Bury them together in the dust; imprison them in the grave.
- **Job 40:14**
Then I will confess to you that your own right hand can save you.
- **Job 40:15**
Look at Behemoth, which I made along with you. He feeds on grass like an ox.
- **Job 40:16**
See the strength of his loins and the power in the muscles of his belly.
- **Job 40:17**
His tail sways like a cedar; the sinews of his thighs are tightly knit.
- **Job 40:18**
His bones are tubes of bronze; his limbs are rods of iron.
- **Job 40:19**
He is the foremost of God’s works; only his Maker can draw the sword against him.
- **Job 40:20**
The hills yield him their produce, while all the beasts of the field play nearby.
- **Job 40:21**
He lies under the lotus plants, hidden among the reeds of the marsh.
- **Job 40:22**
The lotus plants conceal him in their shade; the willows of the brook surround him.
- **Job 40:23**
Though the river rages, Behemoth is unafraid; he remains secure, though the Jordan surges to his mouth.
- **Job 40:24**
Can anyone capture him as he looks on, or pierce his nose with a snare?
- **Job 41:1**
“Can you pull in Leviathan with a hook or tie down his tongue with a rope?
- **Job 41:2**
Can you put a cord through his nose or pierce his jaw with a hook?
- **Job 41:3**
Will he beg you for mercy or speak to you softly?
- **Job 41:4**
Will he make a covenant with you to take him as a slave for life?
- **Job 41:5**
Can you pet him like a bird or put him on a leash for your maidens?
- **Job 41:6**
Will traders barter for him or divide him among the merchants?
- **Job 41:7**
Can you fill his hide with harpoons or his head with fishing spears?
- **Job 41:8**
If you lay a hand on him, you will remember the battle and never repeat it!
- **Job 41:9**
Surely hope of overcoming him is false. Is not the sight of him overwhelming?
- **Job 41:10**
No one is so fierce as to rouse Leviathan. Then who is able to stand against Me?
- **Job 41:11**
Who has given to Me that I should repay him? Everything under heaven is Mine.
- **Job 41:12**
I cannot keep silent about his limbs, his power and graceful form.
- **Job 41:13**
Who can strip off his outer coat? Who can approach him with a bridle?
- **Job 41:14**
Who can open his jaws, ringed by his fearsome teeth?
- **Job 41:15**
His rows of scales are his pride, tightly sealed together.
- **Job 41:16**
One scale is so near to another that no air can pass between them.
- **Job 41:17**
They are joined to one another; they clasp and cannot be separated.
- **Job 41:18**
His snorting flashes with light, and his eyes are like the rays of dawn.
- **Job 41:19**
Firebrands stream from his mouth; fiery sparks shoot forth!
- **Job 41:20**
Smoke billows from his nostrils as from a boiling pot over burning reeds.
- **Job 41:21**
His breath sets coals ablaze, and flames pour from his mouth.
- **Job 41:22**
Strength resides in his neck, and dismay leaps before him.
- **Job 41:23**
The folds of his flesh are tightly joined; they are firm and immovable.
- **Job 41:24**
His chest is as hard as a rock, as hard as a lower millstone!
- **Job 41:25**
When Leviathan rises up, the mighty are terrified; they withdraw before his thrashing.
- **Job 41:26**
The sword that reaches him has no effect, nor does the spear or dart or arrow.
- **Job 41:27**
He regards iron as straw and bronze as rotten wood.
- **Job 41:28**
No arrow can make him flee; slingstones become like chaff to him.
- **Job 41:29**
A club is regarded as straw, and he laughs at the sound of the lance.
- **Job 41:30**
His undersides are jagged potsherds, spreading out the mud like a threshing sledge.
- **Job 41:31**
He makes the depths seethe like a cauldron; he makes the sea like a jar of ointment.
- **Job 41:32**
He leaves a glistening wake behind him; one would think the deep had white hair!
- **Job 41:33**
Nothing on earth is his equal—a creature devoid of fear!
- **Job 41:34**
He looks down on all the haughty; he is king over all the proud.”
- **Job 42:1**
Then Job replied to the LORD:
- **Job 42:2**
“I know that You can do all things and that no plan of Yours can be thwarted.
- **Job 42:3**
You asked, ‘Who is this who conceals My counsel without knowledge?’ Surely I spoke of things I did not understand, things too wonderful for me to know.
- **Job 42:4**
You said, ‘Listen now, and I will speak. I will question you, and you shall inform Me.’
- **Job 42:5**
My ears had heard of You, but now my eyes have seen You.
- **Job 42:6**
Therefore I retract my words, and I repent in dust and ashes.”
- **Job 42:7**
After the LORD had spoken these words to Job, He said to Eliphaz the Temanite, “My wrath is kindled against you and your two friends. For you have not spoken about Me accurately, as My servant Job has.
- **Job 42:8**
So now, take seven bulls and seven rams, go to My servant Job, and sacrifice a burnt offering for yourselves. Then My servant Job will pray for you, for I will accept his prayer and not deal with you according to your folly. For you have not spoken accurately about Me, as My servant Job has.”
- **Job 42:9**
So Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite went and did as the LORD had told them; and the LORD accepted Job’s request.
- **Job 42:10**
After Job had prayed for his friends, the LORD restored his prosperity and doubled his former possessions.
- **Job 42:11**
All his brothers and sisters and prior acquaintances came and dined with him in his house. They consoled him and comforted him over all the adversity that the LORD had brought upon him. And each one gave him a piece of silver and a gold ring.
- **Job 42:12**
So the LORD blessed Job’s latter days more than his first. He owned 14,000 sheep, 6,000 camels, 1,000 yoke of oxen, and 1,000 female donkeys.
- **Job 42:13**
And he also had seven sons and three daughters.
- **Job 42:14**
He named his first daughter Jemimah, his second Keziah, and his third Keren-happuch.
- **Job 42:15**
No women as beautiful as Job’s daughters could be found in all the land, and their father granted them an inheritance among their brothers.
- **Job 42:16**
After this, Job lived 140 years and saw his children and their children to the fourth generation.
- **Job 42:17**
And so Job died, old and full of years.
