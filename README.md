# Berean Standard (Study) Bible Markdown for Logseq

I've reformatted the BSB for use in Logseq so that bible verses can be used anywhere in Logseq by using block references (()).  The files use namesspaces so each book is located at 'Holy Bible/Name of Book'. 

The 'Holy Bible' page lists the 66 books grouped by Old and New Testament.

The original files are [located here](https://bereanbible.com/bsb.txt) and the license is as follows:

## Use of the Berean Standard Bible Markdown for Logseq

1. Simply download a zip of the files and unzip to your Logseq graph directory. I recommend deleting the Readme.md file.
2. Re-index your graph
3. The files use namespaces to group the books together: Holy Bible/Name of Book
4. To reference a verse, type (( and type the name of the book plus the chapter and verse.  For instance (( John 3:16 )) - this will then display the verse in your current page.
