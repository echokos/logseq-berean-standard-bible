- **Proverbs 1:1**
These are the proverbs of Solomon son of David, king of Israel,
- **Proverbs 1:2**
for gaining wisdom and discipline, for comprehending words of insight,
- **Proverbs 1:3**
and for receiving instruction in wise living and in righteousness, justice, and equity.
- **Proverbs 1:4**
To impart prudence to the simple and knowledge and discretion to the young,
- **Proverbs 1:5**
let the wise listen and gain instruction, and the discerning acquire wise counsel
- **Proverbs 1:6**
by understanding the proverbs and parables, the sayings and riddles of the wise.
- **Proverbs 1:7**
The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge, but fools despise wisdom and discipline.
- **Proverbs 1:8**
Listen, my son, to your father’s instruction, and do not forsake the teaching of your mother.
- **Proverbs 1:9**
For they are a garland of grace on your head and a pendant around your neck.
- **Proverbs 1:10**
My son, if sinners entice you, do not yield to them.
- **Proverbs 1:11**
If they say, “Come along, let us lie in wait for blood, let us ambush the innocent without cause,
- **Proverbs 1:12**
let us swallow them alive like Sheol, and whole like those descending into the Pit.
- **Proverbs 1:13**
We will find all manner of precious goods; we will fill our houses with plunder.
- **Proverbs 1:14**
Throw in your lot with us; let us all share one purse”—
- **Proverbs 1:15**
my son, do not walk the road with them or set foot upon their path.
- **Proverbs 1:16**
For their feet run to evil, and they are swift to shed blood.
- **Proverbs 1:17**
How futile it is to spread the net where any bird can see it!
- **Proverbs 1:18**
But they lie in wait for their own blood; they ambush their own lives.
- **Proverbs 1:19**
Such is the fate of all who are greedy, whose unjust gain takes the lives of its possessors.
- **Proverbs 1:20**
Wisdom calls out in the street, she lifts her voice in the square;
- **Proverbs 1:21**
in the main concourse she cries aloud, at the city gates she makes her speech:
- **Proverbs 1:22**
“How long, O simple ones, will you love your simple ways? How long will scoffers delight in their scorn and fools hate knowledge?
- **Proverbs 1:23**
If you had repented at my rebuke, then surely I would have poured out my spirit on you; I would have made my words known to you.
- **Proverbs 1:24**
Because you refused my call, and no one took my outstretched hand,
- **Proverbs 1:25**
because you neglected all my counsel, and wanted none of my correction,
- **Proverbs 1:26**
in turn I will mock your calamity; I will sneer when terror strikes you,
- **Proverbs 1:27**
when your dread comes like a storm, and your destruction like a whirlwind, when distress and anguish overwhelm you.
- **Proverbs 1:28**
Then they will call on me, but I will not answer; they will earnestly seek me, but will not find me.
- **Proverbs 1:29**
For they hated knowledge and chose not to fear the LORD.
- **Proverbs 1:30**
They accepted none of my counsel; they despised all my reproof.
- **Proverbs 1:31**
So they will eat the fruit of their own way, and be filled with their own devices.
- **Proverbs 1:32**
For the waywardness of the simple will slay them, and the complacency of fools will destroy them.
- **Proverbs 1:33**
But whoever listens to me will dwell in safety, secure from the fear of evil.”
- **Proverbs 2:1**
My son, if you accept my words and hide my commandments within you,
- **Proverbs 2:2**
if you incline your ear to wisdom and direct your heart to understanding,
- **Proverbs 2:3**
if you truly call out to insight and lift your voice to understanding,
- **Proverbs 2:4**
if you seek it like silver and search it out like hidden treasure,
- **Proverbs 2:5**
then you will discern the fear of the LORD and discover the knowledge of God.
- **Proverbs 2:6**
For the LORD gives wisdom; from His mouth come knowledge and understanding.
- **Proverbs 2:7**
He stores up sound wisdom for the upright; He is a shield to those who walk with integrity,
- **Proverbs 2:8**
to guard the paths of justice and protect the way of His saints.
- **Proverbs 2:9**
Then you will discern righteousness and justice and equity—every good path.
- **Proverbs 2:10**
For wisdom will enter your heart, and knowledge will delight your soul.
- **Proverbs 2:11**
Discretion will watch over you, and understanding will guard you,
- **Proverbs 2:12**
to deliver you from the way of evil, from the man who speaks perversity,
- **Proverbs 2:13**
from those who leave the straight paths to walk in the ways of darkness,
- **Proverbs 2:14**
from those who enjoy doing evil and rejoice in the twistedness of evil,
- **Proverbs 2:15**
whose paths are crooked and whose ways are devious.
- **Proverbs 2:16**
It will rescue you from the forbidden woman, from the stranger with seductive words
- **Proverbs 2:17**
who abandons the partner of her youth and forgets the covenant of her God.
- **Proverbs 2:18**
For her house sinks down to death, and her tracks to the departed spirits.
- **Proverbs 2:19**
None who go to her return or negotiate the paths of life.
- **Proverbs 2:20**
So you will follow in the ways of the good, and keep to the paths of the righteous.
- **Proverbs 2:21**
For the upright will inhabit the land, and the blameless will remain in it;
- **Proverbs 2:22**
but the wicked will be cut off from the land, and the unfaithful will be uprooted.
- **Proverbs 3:1**
My son, do not forget my teaching, but let your heart keep my commandments;
- **Proverbs 3:2**
for they will add length to your days, years and peace to your life.
- **Proverbs 3:3**
Never let loving devotion or faithfulness leave you; bind them around your neck, write them on the tablet of your heart.
- **Proverbs 3:4**
Then you will find favor and high regard in the sight of God and man.
- **Proverbs 3:5**
Trust in the LORD with all your heart, and lean not on your own understanding;
- **Proverbs 3:6**
in all your ways acknowledge Him, and He will make your paths straight.
- **Proverbs 3:7**
Be not wise in your own eyes; fear the LORD and turn away from evil.
- **Proverbs 3:8**
This will bring healing to your body and refreshment to your bones.
- **Proverbs 3:9**
Honor the LORD with your wealth and with the firstfruits of all your harvest;
- **Proverbs 3:10**
then your barns will be filled with plenty, and your vats will overflow with new wine.
- **Proverbs 3:11**
My son, do not reject the discipline of the LORD, and do not loathe His rebuke;
- **Proverbs 3:12**
for the LORD disciplines the one He loves, as does a father the son in whom he delights.
- **Proverbs 3:13**
Blessed is the man who finds wisdom, the man who acquires understanding,
- **Proverbs 3:14**
for she is more profitable than silver, and her gain is better than fine gold.
- **Proverbs 3:15**
She is more precious than rubies; nothing you desire compares with her.
- **Proverbs 3:16**
Long life is in her right hand; in her left hand are riches and honor.
- **Proverbs 3:17**
All her ways are pleasant, and all her paths are peaceful.
- **Proverbs 3:18**
She is a tree of life to those who embrace her, and those who lay hold of her are blessed.
- **Proverbs 3:19**
The LORD founded the earth by wisdom and established the heavens by understanding.
- **Proverbs 3:20**
By His knowledge the watery depths were broken open, and the clouds dripped with dew.
- **Proverbs 3:21**
My son, do not lose sight of this: Preserve sound judgment and discernment.
- **Proverbs 3:22**
They will be life to your soul and adornment to your neck.
- **Proverbs 3:23**
Then you will go on your way in safety, and your foot will not stumble.
- **Proverbs 3:24**
When you lie down, you will not be afraid; when you rest, your sleep will be sweet.
- **Proverbs 3:25**
Do not fear sudden danger or the ruin that overtakes the wicked,
- **Proverbs 3:26**
for the LORD will be your confidence and will keep your foot from the snare.
- **Proverbs 3:27**
Do not withhold good from the deserving when it is within your power to act.
- **Proverbs 3:28**
Do not tell your neighbor, “Come back tomorrow and I will provide”—when you already have the means.
- **Proverbs 3:29**
Do not devise evil against your neighbor, for he trustfully dwells beside you.
- **Proverbs 3:30**
Do not accuse a man without cause, when he has done you no harm.
- **Proverbs 3:31**
Do not envy a violent man or choose any of his ways;
- **Proverbs 3:32**
for the LORD detests the perverse, but He is a friend to the upright.
- **Proverbs 3:33**
The curse of the LORD is on the house of the wicked, but He blesses the home of the righteous.
- **Proverbs 3:34**
He mocks the mockers, but gives grace to the humble.
- **Proverbs 3:35**
The wise will inherit honor, but fools are held up to shame.
- **Proverbs 4:1**
Listen, my sons, to a father’s instruction; pay attention and gain understanding.
- **Proverbs 4:2**
For I give you sound teaching; do not abandon my directive.
- **Proverbs 4:3**
When I was a son to my father, tender and the only child of my mother,
- **Proverbs 4:4**
he taught me and said, “Let your heart lay hold of my words; keep my commands and you will live.
- **Proverbs 4:5**
Get wisdom, get understanding; do not forget my words or turn from them.
- **Proverbs 4:6**
Do not forsake wisdom, and she will preserve you; love her, and she will guard you.
- **Proverbs 4:7**
Wisdom is supreme; so acquire wisdom. And whatever you may acquire, gain understanding.
- **Proverbs 4:8**
Prize her, and she will exalt you; if you embrace her, she will honor you.
- **Proverbs 4:9**
She will set a garland of grace on your head; she will present you with a crown of beauty.”
- **Proverbs 4:10**
Listen, my son, and receive my words, and the years of your life will be many.
- **Proverbs 4:11**
I will guide you in the way of wisdom; I will lead you on straight paths.
- **Proverbs 4:12**
When you walk, your steps will not be impeded; when you run, you will not stumble.
- **Proverbs 4:13**
Hold on to instruction; do not let go. Guard it, for it is your life.
- **Proverbs 4:14**
Do not set foot on the path of the wicked or walk in the way of evildoers.
- **Proverbs 4:15**
Avoid it; do not travel on it. Turn from it and pass on by.
- **Proverbs 4:16**
For they cannot sleep unless they do evil; they are deprived of slumber until they make someone fall.
- **Proverbs 4:17**
For they eat the bread of wickedness and drink the wine of violence.
- **Proverbs 4:18**
The path of the righteous is like the first gleam of dawn, shining brighter and brighter until midday.
- **Proverbs 4:19**
But the way of the wicked is like the darkest gloom; they do not know what makes them stumble.
- **Proverbs 4:20**
My son, pay attention to my words; incline your ear to my sayings.
- **Proverbs 4:21**
Do not lose sight of them; keep them within your heart.
- **Proverbs 4:22**
For they are life to those who find them, and health to the whole body.
- **Proverbs 4:23**
Guard your heart with all diligence, for from it flow springs of life.
- **Proverbs 4:24**
Put away deception from your mouth; keep your lips from perverse speech.
- **Proverbs 4:25**
Let your eyes look forward; fix your gaze straight ahead.
- **Proverbs 4:26**
Make a level path for your feet, and all your ways will be sure.
- **Proverbs 4:27**
Do not swerve to the right or to the left; turn your feet away from evil.
- **Proverbs 5:1**
My son, pay attention to my wisdom; incline your ear to my insight,
- **Proverbs 5:2**
that you may maintain discretion and your lips may preserve knowledge.
- **Proverbs 5:3**
Though the lips of the forbidden woman drip honey and her speech is smoother than oil,
- **Proverbs 5:4**
in the end she is bitter as wormwood, sharp as a double-edged sword.
- **Proverbs 5:5**
Her feet go down to death; her steps lead straight to Sheol.
- **Proverbs 5:6**
She does not consider the path of life; she does not know that her ways are unstable.
- **Proverbs 5:7**
So now, my sons, listen to me, and do not turn aside from the words of my mouth.
- **Proverbs 5:8**
Keep your path far from her; do not go near the door of her house,
- **Proverbs 5:9**
lest you concede your vigor to others, and your years to one who is cruel;
- **Proverbs 5:10**
lest strangers feast on your wealth, and your labors enrich the house of a foreigner.
- **Proverbs 5:11**
At the end of your life you will groan when your flesh and your body are spent,
- **Proverbs 5:12**
and you will say, “How I hated discipline, and my heart despised reproof!
- **Proverbs 5:13**
I did not listen to the voice of my teachers or incline my ear to my mentors.
- **Proverbs 5:14**
I am on the brink of utter ruin in the midst of the whole assembly.”
- **Proverbs 5:15**
Drink water from your own cistern, and running water from your own well.
- **Proverbs 5:16**
Why should your springs flow in the streets, your streams of water in the public squares?
- **Proverbs 5:17**
Let them be yours alone, never to be shared with strangers.
- **Proverbs 5:18**
May your fountain be blessed, and may you rejoice in the wife of your youth:
- **Proverbs 5:19**
A loving doe, a graceful fawn—may her breasts satisfy you always; may you be captivated by her love forever.
- **Proverbs 5:20**
Why be captivated, my son, by an adulteress, or embrace the bosom of a stranger?
- **Proverbs 5:21**
For a man’s ways are before the eyes of the LORD, and the LORD examines all his paths.
- **Proverbs 5:22**
The iniquities of a wicked man entrap him; the cords of his sin entangle him.
- **Proverbs 5:23**
He dies for lack of discipline, led astray by his own great folly.
- **Proverbs 6:1**
My son, if you have put up security for your neighbor, if you have struck hands in pledge with a stranger,
- **Proverbs 6:2**
if you have been trapped by the words of your lips, ensnared by the words of your mouth,
- **Proverbs 6:3**
then do this, my son, to free yourself, for you have fallen into your neighbor’s hands: Go, humble yourself, and press your plea with your neighbor.
- **Proverbs 6:4**
Allow no sleep to your eyes or slumber to your eyelids.
- **Proverbs 6:5**
Free yourself, like a gazelle from the hand of the hunter, like a bird from the snare of the fowler.
- **Proverbs 6:6**
Walk in the manner of the ant, O slacker; observe its ways and become wise.
- **Proverbs 6:7**
Without a commander, without an overseer or ruler,
- **Proverbs 6:8**
it prepares its provisions in summer; it gathers its food at harvest.
- **Proverbs 6:9**
How long will you lie there, O slacker? When will you get up from your sleep?
- **Proverbs 6:10**
A little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to rest,
- **Proverbs 6:11**
and poverty will come upon you like a robber, and need like a bandit.
- **Proverbs 6:12**
A worthless person, a wicked man, walks with a perverse mouth,
- **Proverbs 6:13**
winking his eyes, speaking with his feet, and pointing with his fingers.
- **Proverbs 6:14**
With deceit in his heart he devises evil; he continually sows discord.
- **Proverbs 6:15**
Therefore calamity will come upon him suddenly; in an instant he will be shattered beyond recovery.
- **Proverbs 6:16**
There are six things that the LORD hates, seven that are detestable to Him:
- **Proverbs 6:17**
haughty eyes, a lying tongue, hands that shed innocent blood,
- **Proverbs 6:18**
a heart that devises wicked schemes, feet that run swiftly to evil,
- **Proverbs 6:19**
a false witness who gives false testimony, and one who stirs up discord among brothers.
- **Proverbs 6:20**
My son, keep your father’s commandment, and do not forsake your mother’s teaching.
- **Proverbs 6:21**
Bind them always upon your heart; tie them around your neck.
- **Proverbs 6:22**
When you walk, they will guide you; when you lie down, they will watch over you; when you awake, they will speak to you.
- **Proverbs 6:23**
For this commandment is a lamp, this teaching is a light, and the reproofs of discipline are the way to life,
- **Proverbs 6:24**
to keep you from the evil woman, from the smooth tongue of the adulteress.
- **Proverbs 6:25**
Do not lust in your heart for her beauty or let her captivate you with her eyes.
- **Proverbs 6:26**
For the levy of the prostitute is poverty, and the adulteress preys upon your very life.
- **Proverbs 6:27**
Can a man embrace fire and his clothes not be burned?
- **Proverbs 6:28**
Can a man walk on hot coals without scorching his feet?
- **Proverbs 6:29**
So is he who sleeps with another man’s wife; no one who touches her will go unpunished.
- **Proverbs 6:30**
Men do not despise the thief if he steals to satisfy his hunger.
- **Proverbs 6:31**
Yet if caught, he must pay sevenfold; he must give up all the wealth of his house.
- **Proverbs 6:32**
He who commits adultery lacks judgment; whoever does so destroys himself.
- **Proverbs 6:33**
Wounds and dishonor will befall him, and his reproach will never be wiped away.
- **Proverbs 6:34**
For jealousy enrages a husband, and he will show no mercy in the day of vengeance.
- **Proverbs 6:35**
He will not be appeased by any ransom, or persuaded by lavish gifts.
- **Proverbs 7:1**
My son, keep my words and treasure my commandments within you.
- **Proverbs 7:2**
Keep my commandments and live; guard my teachings as the apple of your eye.
- **Proverbs 7:3**
Tie them to your fingers; write them on the tablet of your heart.
- **Proverbs 7:4**
Say to wisdom, “You are my sister,” and call understanding your kinsman,
- **Proverbs 7:5**
that they may keep you from the adulteress, from the stranger with seductive words.
- **Proverbs 7:6**
For at the window of my house I looked through the lattice.
- **Proverbs 7:7**
I saw among the simple, I noticed among the youths, a young man lacking judgment,
- **Proverbs 7:8**
crossing the street near her corner, strolling down the road to her house,
- **Proverbs 7:9**
at twilight, as the day was fading into the dark of the night.
- **Proverbs 7:10**
Then a woman came out to meet him, with the attire of a harlot and cunning of heart.
- **Proverbs 7:11**
She is loud and defiant; her feet do not remain at home.
- **Proverbs 7:12**
Now in the street, now in the squares, she lurks at every corner.
- **Proverbs 7:13**
She seizes him and kisses him; she brazenly says to him:
- **Proverbs 7:14**
“I have made my peace offerings; today I have paid my vows.
- **Proverbs 7:15**
So I came out to meet you; I sought you, and I have found you.
- **Proverbs 7:16**
I have decked my bed with coverings, with colored linen from Egypt.
- **Proverbs 7:17**
I have perfumed my bed with myrrh, with aloes, and with cinnamon.
- **Proverbs 7:18**
Come, let us take our fill of love till morning. Let us delight in loving caresses!
- **Proverbs 7:19**
For my husband is not at home; he has gone on a long journey.
- **Proverbs 7:20**
He took with him a bag of money and will not return till the moon is full.”
- **Proverbs 7:21**
With her great persuasion she entices him; with her flattering lips she lures him.
- **Proverbs 7:22**
He follows her on impulse, like an ox going to the slaughter, like a deer bounding into a trap,
- **Proverbs 7:23**
until an arrow pierces his liver, like a bird darting into a snare—not knowing it will cost him his life.
- **Proverbs 7:24**
Now, my sons, listen to me, and attend to the words of my mouth.
- **Proverbs 7:25**
Do not let your heart turn aside to her ways; do not stray into her paths.
- **Proverbs 7:26**
For she has brought many down to death; her slain are many in number.
- **Proverbs 7:27**
Her house is the road to Sheol, descending to the chambers of death.
- **Proverbs 8:1**
Does not wisdom call out, and understanding raise her voice?
- **Proverbs 8:2**
On the heights overlooking the road, at the crossroads she takes her stand.
- **Proverbs 8:3**
Beside the gates to the city, at the entrances she cries out:
- **Proverbs 8:4**
“To you, O men, I call out, and my cry is to the sons of men.
- **Proverbs 8:5**
O simple ones, learn to be shrewd; O fools, gain understanding.
- **Proverbs 8:6**
Listen, for I speak of noble things, and the opening of my lips will reveal right.
- **Proverbs 8:7**
For my mouth will speak the truth, and wickedness is detestable to my lips.
- **Proverbs 8:8**
All the words of my mouth are righteous; none are crooked or perverse.
- **Proverbs 8:9**
They are all plain to the discerning, and upright to those who find knowledge.
- **Proverbs 8:10**
Receive my instruction instead of silver, and knowledge rather than pure gold.
- **Proverbs 8:11**
For wisdom is more precious than rubies, and nothing you desire compares with her.
- **Proverbs 8:12**
I, wisdom, dwell together with prudence, and I find knowledge and discretion.
- **Proverbs 8:13**
To fear the LORD is to hate evil; I hate arrogant pride, evil conduct, and perverse speech.
- **Proverbs 8:14**
Counsel and sound judgment are mine; I have insight and strength.
- **Proverbs 8:15**
By me kings reign, and rulers enact just laws;
- **Proverbs 8:16**
By me princes rule, and all nobles who govern justly.
- **Proverbs 8:17**
I love those who love me, and those who seek me early shall find me.
- **Proverbs 8:18**
With me are riches and honor, enduring wealth and righteousness.
- **Proverbs 8:19**
My fruit is better than gold, pure gold, and my harvest surpasses choice silver.
- **Proverbs 8:20**
I walk in the way of righteousness, along the paths of justice,
- **Proverbs 8:21**
bestowing wealth on those who love me and making their treasuries full.
- **Proverbs 8:22**
The LORD created me as His first course, before His works of old.
- **Proverbs 8:23**
From everlasting I was established, from the beginning, before the earth began.
- **Proverbs 8:24**
When there were no watery depths, I was brought forth, when no springs were overflowing with water.
- **Proverbs 8:25**
Before the mountains were settled, before the hills, I was brought forth,
- **Proverbs 8:26**
before He made the land or fields, or any of the dust of the earth.
- **Proverbs 8:27**
I was there when He established the heavens, when He inscribed a circle on the face of the deep,
- **Proverbs 8:28**
when He established the clouds above, when the fountains of the deep gushed forth,
- **Proverbs 8:29**
when He set a boundary for the sea, so that the waters would not surpass His command, when He marked out the foundations of the earth.
- **Proverbs 8:30**
Then I was a skilled craftsman at His side, and His delight day by day, rejoicing always in His presence.
- **Proverbs 8:31**
I was rejoicing in His whole world, delighting together in the sons of men.
- **Proverbs 8:32**
Now therefore, my sons, listen to me, for blessed are those who keep my ways.
- **Proverbs 8:33**
Listen to instruction and be wise; do not ignore it.
- **Proverbs 8:34**
Blessed is the man who listens to me, watching daily at my doors, waiting at the posts of my doorway.
- **Proverbs 8:35**
For whoever finds me finds life and obtains the favor of the LORD.
- **Proverbs 8:36**
But he who fails to find me harms himself; all who hate me love death.”
- **Proverbs 9:1**
Wisdom has built her house; she has carved out her seven pillars.
- **Proverbs 9:2**
She has prepared her meat and mixed her wine; she has also set her table.
- **Proverbs 9:3**
She has sent out her maidservants; she calls out from the heights of the city.
- **Proverbs 9:4**
“Whoever is simple, let him turn in here!” she says to him who lacks judgment.
- **Proverbs 9:5**
“Come, eat my bread and drink the wine I have mixed.
- **Proverbs 9:6**
Leave your folly behind, and you will live; walk in the way of understanding.”
- **Proverbs 9:7**
He who corrects a mocker brings shame on himself; he who rebukes a wicked man taints himself.
- **Proverbs 9:8**
Do not rebuke a mocker, or he will hate you; rebuke a wise man, and he will love you.
- **Proverbs 9:9**
Instruct a wise man, and he will be wiser still; teach a righteous man, and he will increase his learning.
- **Proverbs 9:10**
The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom, and knowledge of the Holy One is understanding.
- **Proverbs 9:11**
For through wisdom your days will be multiplied, and years will be added to your life.
- **Proverbs 9:12**
If you are wise, you are wise to your own advantage; but if you scoff, you alone will bear the consequences.
- **Proverbs 9:13**
The woman named Folly is loud; she is naive and knows nothing.
- **Proverbs 9:14**
She sits at the door of her house, on a seat in the heights of the city,

calling out to those who pass by, who make their paths straight.
- **Proverbs 9:16**
“Whoever is simple, let him turn in here!” she says to him who lacks judgment.
