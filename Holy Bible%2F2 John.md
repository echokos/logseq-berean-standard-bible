title:: Holy Bible/2 John

- **2 John 1:1**
The elder, To the chosen lady and her children, whom I love in the truth—and not I alone, but also all who know the truth—
- **2 John 1:2**
because of the truth that abides in us and will be with us forever:
- **2 John 1:3**
Grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and from Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, will be with us in truth and love.
- **2 John 1:4**
I was overjoyed to find some of your children walking in the truth, just as the Father has commanded us.
- **2 John 1:5**
And now I urge you, dear lady—not as a new commandment to you, but one we have had from the beginning—that we love one another.
- **2 John 1:6**
And this is love, that we walk according to His commandments. This is the very commandment you have heard from the beginning, that you must walk in love.
- **2 John 1:7**
For many deceivers have gone out into the world, refusing to confess the coming of Jesus Christ in the flesh. Any such person is the deceiver and the antichrist.
- **2 John 1:8**
Watch yourselves, so that you do not lose what we have worked for, but that you may be fully rewarded.
- **2 John 1:9**
Anyone who runs ahead without remaining in the teaching of Christ does not have God. Whoever remains in His teaching has both the Father and the Son.
- **2 John 1:10**
If anyone comes to you but does not bring this teaching, do not receive him into your home or even greet him.
- **2 John 1:11**
Whoever greets such a person shares in his evil deeds.
- **2 John 1:12**
I have many things to write to you, but I would prefer not to do so with paper and ink. Instead, I hope to come and speak with you face to face, so that our joy may be complete.
- **2 John 1:13**
The children of your elect sister send you greetings.
