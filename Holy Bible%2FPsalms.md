But as for me, my feet had almost stumbled; my steps had nearly slipped.
- **Psalm 73:3**
For I envied the arrogant when I saw the prosperity of the wicked.
- **Psalm 73:4**
They have no struggle in their death; their bodies are well-fed.
- **Psalm 73:5**
They are free of the burdens others carry; they are not afflicted like other men.

- **Psalm 73:17**
until I entered God’s sanctuary; then I discerned their end.
- **Psalm 73:18**
Surely You set them on slick ground; You cast them down into ruin.
- **Psalm 73:19**
How suddenly they are laid waste, completely swept away by terrors!
- **Psalm 73:20**
Like one waking from a dream, so You, O Lord, awaken and despise their form.
- **Psalm 73:21**
When my heart was grieved and I was pierced within,
- **Psalm 73:22**
I was senseless and ignorant; I was a brute beast before You.

- **Psalm 74:3**
Turn Your steps to the everlasting ruins, to everything in the sanctuary the enemy has destroyed.
- **Psalm 74:4**
Your foes have roared within Your meeting place; they have unfurled their banners as signs,
- **Psalm 74:5**
like men wielding axes in a thicket of trees
- **Psalm 74:6**
and smashing all the carvings with hatchets and picks.
- **Psalm 74:7**
They have burned Your sanctuary to the ground; they have defiled the dwelling place of Your Name.
- **Psalm 74:8**
They said in their hearts, “We will crush them completely.” They burned down every place where God met us in the land.
- **Psalm 74:9**
There are no signs for us to see. There is no longer any prophet. And none of us knows how long this will last.
- **Psalm 74:10**
How long, O God, will the enemy taunt You? Will the foe revile Your name forever?
- **Psalm 74:11**
Why do You withdraw Your strong right hand? Stretch it out to destroy them!
- **Psalm 74:12**
Yet God is my King from ancient times, working salvation on the earth.

You broke open the fountain and the flood; You dried up the ever-flowing rivers.

You set all the boundaries of the earth; You made the summer and winter.
- **Psalm 74:18**
Remember how the enemy has mocked You, O LORD, how a foolish people has spurned Your name.

Do not deliver the soul of Your dove to beasts; do not forget the lives of Your afflicted forever.
- **Psalm 74:20**
Consider Your covenant, for haunts of violence fill the dark places of the land.

Do not let the oppressed retreat in shame; may the poor and needy praise Your name.
- **Psalm 74:22**
Rise up, O God; defend Your cause! Remember how the fool mocks You all day long.
- **Psalm 74:23**
Do not disregard the clamor of Your adversaries, the uproar of Your enemies that ascends continually.
- **Psalm 75:1**

- **Psalm 75:4**
I say to the proud, ‘Do not boast,’ and to the wicked, ‘Do not lift up your horn.
- **Psalm 75:5**
Do not lift up your horn against heaven or speak with an outstretched neck.’”

For exaltation comes neither from east nor west, nor out of the desert,
- **Psalm 75:7**
but it is God who judges; He brings down one and exalts another.
- **Psalm 75:8**
For a cup is in the hand of the LORD, full of foaming wine mixed with spices. He pours from His cup, and all the wicked of the earth drink it down to the dregs.
- **Psalm 75:9**

The valiant lie plundered; they sleep their last sleep. No men of might could lift a hand.
- **Psalm 76:6**
At Your rebuke, O God of Jacob, both horse and rider lie stunned.
- **Psalm 76:7**
You alone are to be feared. When You are angry, who can stand before You?

For the choirmaster. According to Jeduthun. A Psalm of Asaph. I cried out to God; I cried aloud to God to hear me.
- **Psalm 77:2**
In the day of trouble I sought the Lord; through the night my outstretched hands did not grow weary; my soul refused to be comforted.
- **Psalm 77:3**
I remembered You, O God, and I groaned; I mused and my spirit grew faint. Selah
- **Psalm 77:4**
You have kept my eyes from closing; I am too troubled to speak.
- **Psalm 77:5**
I considered the days of old, the years long in the past.
- **Psalm 77:6**
At night I remembered my song; in my heart I mused, and my spirit pondered:
- **Psalm 77:7**
“Will the Lord spurn us forever and never show His favor again?
- **Psalm 77:8**
Is His loving devotion gone forever? Has His promise failed for all time?
- **Psalm 77:9**
Has God forgotten to be gracious? Has His anger shut off His compassion?” Selah
- **Psalm 77:10**
So I said, “I am grieved that the right hand of the Most High has changed.”
- **Psalm 77:11**
I will remember the works of the LORD; yes, I will remember Your wonders of old.
- **Psalm 77:12**
I will reflect on all You have done and ponder Your mighty deeds.
- **Psalm 77:13**
Your way, O God, is holy. What god is so great as our God?

- **Psalm 78:1**
A Maskil of Asaph. Give ear, O my people, to my instruction; listen to the words of my mouth.
- **Psalm 78:2**
I will open my mouth in parables; I will utter things hidden from the beginning,
- **Psalm 78:3**
that we have heard and known and our fathers have relayed to us.
- **Psalm 78:4**
We will not hide them from their children, but will declare to the next generation the praises of the LORD and His might, and the wonders He has performed.
- **Psalm 78:5**
For He established a testimony in Jacob and appointed a law in Israel, which He commanded our fathers to teach to their children,
- **Psalm 78:6**
that the coming generation would know them—even children yet to be born—to arise and tell their own children
- **Psalm 78:7**
that they should put their confidence in God, not forgetting His works, but keeping His commandments.

- **Psalm 78:9**
The archers of Ephraim turned back on the day of battle.
- **Psalm 78:10**
They failed to keep God’s covenant and refused to live by His law.

He led them with a cloud by day and with a light of fire all night.
- **Psalm 78:15**
He split the rocks in the wilderness and gave them drink as abundant as the seas.

He brought streams from the stone and made water flow down like rivers.
- **Psalm 78:17**
But they continued to sin against Him, rebelling in the desert against the Most High.
- **Psalm 78:18**
They willfully tested God by demanding the food they craved.
- **Psalm 78:19**
They spoke against God, saying, “Can God really prepare a table in the wilderness?
- **Psalm 78:20**
When He struck the rock, water gushed out and torrents raged. But can He also give bread or supply His people with meat?”
- **Psalm 78:21**
Therefore the LORD heard and was filled with wrath; so a fire was kindled against Jacob, and His anger flared against Israel,
- **Psalm 78:22**
because they did not believe God or rely on His salvation.
- **Psalm 78:23**
Yet He commanded the clouds above and opened the doors of the heavens.

- **Psalm 78:31**
God’s anger flared against them, and He put to death their strongest and subdued the young men of Israel.
- **Psalm 78:32**
In spite of all this, they kept on sinning; despite His wonderful works, they did not believe.
- **Psalm 78:33**
So He ended their days in futility, and their years in sudden terror.

And they remembered that God was their Rock, that God Most High was their Redeemer.

But they deceived Him with their mouths, and lied to Him with their tongues.
- **Psalm 78:37**
Their hearts were disloyal to Him, and they were unfaithful to His covenant.
- **Psalm 78:38**

He abandoned their cattle to the hail and their livestock to bolts of lightning.
- **Psalm 78:49**
He unleashed His fury against them, wrath, indignation, and calamity—a band of destroying angels.
- **Psalm 78:50**
He cleared a path for His anger; He did not spare them from death but delivered their lives to the plague.
- **Psalm 78:51**
He struck all the firstborn of Egypt, the virility in the tents of Ham.
- **Psalm 78:52**
He led out His people like sheep and guided them like a flock in the wilderness.
- **Psalm 78:53**
He led them safely, so they did not fear, but the sea engulfed their enemies.
- **Psalm 78:54**
He brought them to His holy land, to the mountain His right hand had acquired.
- **Psalm 78:55**
He drove out nations before them and apportioned their inheritance; He settled the tribes of Israel in their tents.

- **Psalm 78:61**
He delivered His strength to captivity, and His splendor to the hand of the adversary.
- **Psalm 78:62**
He surrendered His people to the sword because He was enraged by His heritage.
- **Psalm 78:63**
Fire consumed His young men, and their maidens were left without wedding songs.
- **Psalm 78:64**
His priests fell by the sword, but their widows could not lament.
- **Psalm 78:65**
Then the Lord awoke as from sleep, like a mighty warrior overcome by wine.
- **Psalm 78:66**
He beat back His foes; He put them to everlasting shame.
- **Psalm 78:67**
He rejected the tent of Joseph and refused the tribe of Ephraim.
- **Psalm 78:68**
But He chose the tribe of Judah, Mount Zion, which He loved.
- **Psalm 78:69**
He built His sanctuary like the heights, like the earth He has established forever.
- **Psalm 78:70**
He chose David His servant and took him from the sheepfolds;
- **Psalm 78:71**
from tending the ewes He brought him to be shepherd of His people Jacob, of Israel His inheritance.

Pour out Your wrath on the nations that do not acknowledge You, on the kingdoms that refuse to call on Your name,

for they have devoured Jacob and devastated his homeland.
- **Psalm 79:8**
Do not hold past sins against us; let Your compassion come quickly, for we are brought low.

The mountains were covered by its shade, and the mighty cedars with its branches.
- **Psalm 80:11**
It sent out its branches to the Sea, and its shoots toward the River.
- **Psalm 80:12**

- **Psalm 105:13**
they wandered from nation to nation, from one kingdom to another.
- **Psalm 105:14**
He let no man oppress them; He rebuked kings on their behalf:
- **Psalm 105:15**
“Do not touch My anointed ones! Do no harm to My prophets!”
- **Psalm 105:16**
He called down famine on the land and cut off all their supplies of food.
- **Psalm 105:17**
He sent a man before them—Joseph, sold as a slave.
- **Psalm 105:18**
They bruised his feet with shackles and placed his neck in irons,
- **Psalm 105:19**
until his prediction came true and the word of the LORD proved him right.
- **Psalm 105:20**
The king sent and released him; the ruler of peoples set him free.
- **Psalm 105:21**
He made him master of his household, ruler over all his substance,
- **Psalm 105:22**
to instruct his princes as he pleased and teach his elders wisdom.
- **Psalm 105:23**
Then Israel entered Egypt; Jacob dwelt in the land of Ham.
- **Psalm 105:24**
And the LORD made His people very fruitful, more numerous than their foes,
- **Psalm 105:25**
whose hearts He turned to hate His people, to conspire against His servants.
- **Psalm 105:26**
He sent Moses His servant, and Aaron, whom He had chosen.
- **Psalm 105:27**
They performed His miraculous signs among them, and wonders in the land of Ham.
- **Psalm 105:28**
He sent darkness, and it became dark—yet they defied His words.
- **Psalm 105:29**
He turned their waters to blood and caused their fish to die.
- **Psalm 105:30**
Their land teemed with frogs, even in their royal chambers.
- **Psalm 105:31**
He spoke, and insects swarmed—gnats throughout their country.
- **Psalm 105:32**
He gave them hail for rain, with lightning throughout their land.
- **Psalm 105:33**
He struck their vines and fig trees and shattered the trees of their country.
- **Psalm 105:34**
He spoke, and the locusts came—young locusts without number.
- **Psalm 105:35**
They devoured every plant in their land and consumed the produce of their soil.
- **Psalm 105:36**
Then He struck all the firstborn in their land, the firstfruits of all their vigor.
- **Psalm 105:37**
He brought Israel out with silver and gold, and none among His tribes stumbled.
- **Psalm 105:38**
Egypt was glad when they departed, for the dread of Israel had fallen on them.
- **Psalm 105:39**
He spread a cloud as a covering and a fire to light up the night.
- **Psalm 105:40**
They asked, and He brought quail and satisfied them with the bread of heaven.
- **Psalm 105:41**
He opened a rock, and water gushed out; it flowed like a river in the desert.
- **Psalm 105:42**
For He remembered His holy promise to Abraham His servant.
- **Psalm 105:43**
He brought forth His people with rejoicing, His chosen with shouts of joy.
- **Psalm 105:44**
He gave them the lands of the nations, that they might inherit the fruit of others’ labor,
- **Psalm 105:45**
that they might keep His statutes and obey His laws. Hallelujah!
- **Psalm 106:1**
Hallelujah! Give thanks to the LORD, for He is good; His loving devotion endures forever.

Who can describe the mighty acts of the LORD or fully proclaim His praise?

Blessed are those who uphold justice, who practice righteousness at all times.
- **Psalm 106:4**
Remember me, O LORD, in Your favor to Your people; visit me with Your salvation,
- **Psalm 106:5**
that I may see the prosperity of Your chosen ones, and rejoice in the gladness of Your nation, and give glory with Your inheritance.
- **Psalm 106:6**
We have sinned like our fathers; we have done wrong and acted wickedly.
- **Psalm 106:7**
Our fathers in Egypt did not grasp Your wonders or remember Your abundant kindness; but they rebelled by the sea, there at the Red Sea.
- **Psalm 106:8**
Yet He saved them for the sake of His name, to make His power known.
- **Psalm 106:9**
He rebuked the Red Sea, and it dried up; He led them through the depths as through a desert.
- **Psalm 106:10**
He saved them from the hand that hated them; He redeemed them from the hand of the enemy.
- **Psalm 106:11**
The waters covered their foes; not one of them remained.
- **Psalm 106:12**
Then they believed His promises and sang His praise.
- **Psalm 106:13**
Yet they soon forgot His works and failed to wait for His counsel.
- **Psalm 106:14**
They craved intensely in the wilderness and tested God in the desert.
- **Psalm 106:15**
So He granted their request, but sent a wasting disease upon them.
- **Psalm 106:16**
In the camp they envied Moses, as well as Aaron, the holy one of the LORD.
- **Psalm 106:17**
The earth opened up and swallowed Dathan; it covered the assembly of Abiram.
- **Psalm 106:18**
Then fire blazed through their company; flames consumed the wicked.
- **Psalm 106:19**
At Horeb they made a calf and worshiped a molten image.
- **Psalm 106:20**
They exchanged their Glory for the image of a grass-eating ox.
- **Psalm 106:21**
They forgot God their Savior, who did great things in Egypt,
- **Psalm 106:22**
wondrous works in the land of Ham, and awesome deeds by the Red Sea.
- **Psalm 106:23**
So He said He would destroy them—had not Moses His chosen one stood before Him in the breach to divert His wrath from destroying them.
- **Psalm 106:24**
They despised the pleasant land; they did not believe His promise.
- **Psalm 106:25**
They grumbled in their tents and did not listen to the voice of the LORD.
- **Psalm 106:26**
So He raised His hand and swore to cast them down in the wilderness,
- **Psalm 106:27**
to disperse their offspring among the nations and scatter them throughout the lands.
- **Psalm 106:28**
They yoked themselves to Baal of Peor and ate sacrifices offered to lifeless gods.
- **Psalm 106:29**
So they provoked the LORD to anger with their deeds, and a plague broke out among them.
- **Psalm 106:30**
But Phinehas stood and intervened, and the plague was restrained.
- **Psalm 106:31**
It was credited to him as righteousness for endless generations to come.
- **Psalm 106:32**
At the waters of Meribah they angered the LORD, and trouble came to Moses because of them.
- **Psalm 106:33**
For they rebelled against His Spirit, and Moses spoke rashly with his lips.
- **Psalm 106:34**
They did not destroy the peoples as the LORD had commanded them,
- **Psalm 106:35**
but they mingled with the nations and adopted their customs.
- **Psalm 106:36**
They worshiped their idols, which became a snare to them.
- **Psalm 106:37**
They sacrificed their sons and their daughters to demons.
- **Psalm 106:38**
They shed innocent blood—the blood of their sons and daughters, whom they sacrificed to the idols of Canaan, and the land was polluted with blood.
- **Psalm 106:39**
They defiled themselves by their actions and prostituted themselves by their deeds.
- **Psalm 106:40**
So the anger of the LORD burned against His people, and He abhorred His own inheritance.
- **Psalm 106:41**
He delivered them into the hand of the nations, and those who hated them ruled over them.
- **Psalm 106:42**
Their enemies oppressed them, and subdued them under their hand.
- **Psalm 106:43**
Many times He rescued them, but they were bent on rebellion and sank down in their iniquity.
- **Psalm 106:44**
Nevertheless He heard their cry; He took note of their distress.
- **Psalm 106:45**
And He remembered His covenant with them, and relented by the abundance of His loving devotion.
- **Psalm 106:46**
He made them objects of compassion to all who held them captive.
- **Psalm 106:47**
Save us, O LORD our God, and gather us from the nations, that we may give thanks to Your holy name, that we may glory in Your praise.

and gathered from the lands, from east and west, from north and south.
- **Psalm 107:4**
Some wandered in desert wastelands, finding no path to a city in which to dwell.

They were hungry and thirsty; their soul fainted within them.

Some sat in darkness and in the shadow of death, prisoners in affliction and chains,
- **Psalm 107:11**
because they rebelled against the words of God and despised the counsel of the Most High.
- **Psalm 107:12**
He humbled their hearts with hard labor; they stumbled, and there was no one to help.
- **Psalm 107:13**
Then they cried out to the LORD in their trouble, and He saved them from their distress.
- **Psalm 107:14**
He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death and broke away their chains.
- **Psalm 107:15**

Fools, in their rebellious ways, and through their iniquities, suffered affliction.
- **Psalm 107:18**

Then they cried out to the LORD in their trouble, and He saved them from their distress.
- **Psalm 107:20**

Let them give thanks to the LORD for His loving devotion and His wonders to the sons of men.
- **Psalm 107:22**
Let them offer sacrifices of thanksgiving and declare His works with rejoicing.
- **Psalm 107:23**
Others went out to sea in ships, conducting trade on the mighty waters.
- **Psalm 107:24**
They saw the works of the LORD, and His wonders in the deep.
- **Psalm 107:25**
For He spoke and raised a tempest that lifted the waves of the sea.
- **Psalm 107:26**
They mounted up to the heavens, then sunk to the depths; their courage melted in their anguish.
- **Psalm 107:27**
They reeled and staggered like drunkards, and all their skill was useless.
- **Psalm 107:28**
Then they cried out to the LORD in their trouble, and He brought them out of their distress.
- **Psalm 107:29**
He calmed the storm to a whisper, and the waves of the sea were hushed.
- **Psalm 107:30**
They rejoiced in the silence, and He guided them to the harbor they desired.
- **Psalm 107:31**
Let them give thanks to the LORD for His loving devotion and His wonders to the sons of men.
- **Psalm 107:32**
Let them exalt Him in the assembly of the people and praise Him in the council of the elders.
- **Psalm 107:33**
He turns rivers into deserts, springs of water into thirsty ground,
- **Psalm 107:34**
and fruitful land into fields of salt, because of the wickedness of its dwellers.
- **Psalm 107:35**
He turns a desert into pools of water and a dry land into flowing springs.
- **Psalm 107:36**
He causes the hungry to settle there, that they may establish a city in which to dwell.
- **Psalm 107:37**
They sow fields and plant vineyards that yield a fruitful harvest.
- **Psalm 107:38**
He blesses them, and they multiply greatly; He does not let their herds diminish.
- **Psalm 107:39**
When they are decreased and humbled by oppression, evil, and sorrow,
- **Psalm 107:40**
He pours out contempt on the nobles and makes them wander in a trackless wasteland.
- **Psalm 107:41**
But He lifts the needy from affliction and increases their families like flocks.
- **Psalm 107:42**
The upright see and rejoice, and all iniquity shuts its mouth.
